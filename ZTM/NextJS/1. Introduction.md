# Two Paths: App / Pages

## App Router
----
New  and finally stable

- Server Components - Components that render on the server and by default , are server components
- Client Components - Components that render on the client, and you need to explicitly say the components are client components
- New MetaData API - Define your app metadata (e.g. meta and link tags inside your HTML head element) for improved SEO and web shareability
- Data fetching methods - How you can fetch, cache, and revalidate data in React, and Next js can be done through 'fetch'
- Caching Strategy - improves your applications performance and reduces cost by caching rendering work and data requests
```JavaScript
export default async function Page() {
  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.
  // Similar to `getStaticProps`
  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted
  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })

  // This request should be refetched on every request
  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`
  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })

  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds
  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option
  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https:/...`, {
  next : { revalidate: 10 },
  })
}
```
- New Special Files - Loading, Error, Page etc are all special files
