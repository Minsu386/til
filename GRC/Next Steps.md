GRC Analyst Course – What Next?  
What jobs use the skills from the GRC Analyst Course?  
• There are two categories of jobs that you should consider: Internal & External GRC Analysts  
o An internal GRC Analyst works for one company and could be asked to work with diBerent  
standards or frameworks depending on the company’s needs.  
o An external GRC Analyst works as an assessor or advisor for multiple companies usually with  
one standard or framework.  
What organiza;ons employ these types of jobs?  
• You should consider organizations that operate in regulated industries and Cybersecurity  
assessment companies.  
o Regulated industries have their own information security standards and assessments.  
Examples of these industries include: Financial, Healthcare, Government, etc.  
§ Within these regulated industries, you could be an internal company GRC Analyst, or work  
for a security assessment company that serves that industry.  
o Cyber security assessment companies usually serve multiple industries, although some  
companies may gravitate towards one or two primary standards that they assess.  
§ To find companies that conduct assessments you are interested in, do a web search for  
companies that provide those types of assessments.  
§ For government assessments, check out the assessor companies for both FedRAMP (Link:  
https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/assessors) and CMMC (Link: https://cyberab.org/Catalog)  
• FedRAMP tends to serve larger organizations, while CMMC covers small to large-sized  
organizations.  
How can you best navigate the hiring process of these organizions?  
• Look for internships as well as full-time roles.  
• Information Security certifications can be a qualifier for certain jobs.  
o Well-known certifications: Sec+, CISM, CISA, CISSP  
• Hands-on experience doesn’t have to come from professional experience. “Home labs” or online  
learning labs are excellent resources to experiment and test security controls.  
• Think about what kind of assessor you want to be:  
o There are deep technical knowledge assessors such as penetration testers, vulnerability  
scanners, network security practitioners, etc.  
o There are also broad knowledge information security assessors. These assessors are reliant on  
technical expertise personnel to answer control questions, so these assessors focus on  
knowing what questions to ask and who to ask.
