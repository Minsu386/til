Discussion Topic: Links from today's Class Connect SessionLinks from today's Class Connect Session

Good afternoon students,

Thanks to everyone who participated in today's Class Connect Session. We had some great conversations, and there were several links shared that I want to ensure everyone gets to see. The recording of this session will be sent out later this week.

First, there was a question about information security policies. To help everyone see what these policies can look like, here are some links to great templates. Remember that policy is subjective, and organizations tend to group information security control domains into an extensive master policy or specific control domain policies. Also, you will get to review sample policies during the hands-on exercise of Module 4.

Second, I gave a short presentation on how the US defense supply chain (DoD contractors) has moved recently from a security for the sake of security requirement to a security for the sake of security **AND compliance** requirement. Key ideas here are: 1) Security and compliance are not the same thing (though often opposite sides of the same coin), 2) GRC Analysts play a key role in **verifying** that security controls have been implemented, & 3) As time moves forward, information security **compliance** is becoming more the norm and regulated industries are leading this movement. Here are the links I shared:

Third, we discussed how NIST is our friend and all that the Special Publications can give guidance on. Here's the link to the 211 current SPs: [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp1800Links to an external site.](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp1800). Module 1's readings are three of these publications, but look at what other SPs exist.

Fourth, we discussed open-source PenTest tools. These tools are beyond the scope of this course, but if you are interested in the deeper technical assessing/testing actions of a PenTest, I highly encourage you to start getting familiar with the most common tools in use. Note: exercise sound judgment in what you do with these tools! These are the same tools used by criminal hackers, so please only use these tools on devices/systems where you have permission to do so! Here are some links:

Finally, we discussed what an information security risk assessment can look like. Here are some helpful links:
