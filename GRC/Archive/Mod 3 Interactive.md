## Steps for creating and Using a CSF Org Profile
----
- **Scope the Org Profile** - Document the high-level facts and assumptions to define its scope. 

- **Gather the info needed to prepare the Orgs Profile** - Orgs Policies, Risk management  Priorities and resources, enterprise risk profiles, Business Impact Analysis (BIA) registers, 

- **Create the Orgs Profile** - Determine what info the profile should include for the selected CSF outcomes and doc the needed info. Consider risk implications of the current profile to inform target profile planning and prioritization. 

- **Analyze the gaps between the *Current* and *Target* Profiles and create an action plan** Conduct a Gap Analysis to identify and analyze the differences between the Current and Target Profiles, and develop a prioritized action plan (e.g., risk register, risk detail report, plan of action, and milestones [POA&M]) to address those gaps

- **Implement the action plan and update the Orgs Profile** - Follow the action plan to address the gaps and move the orgs toward the Target Profile. An action plan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing.

# Intro to CSF Profiles and Tiers
----
Every Org profile includes a Current Profile, Target Profile, or both profiles

## Tiers
----
Tier 1 - Partial
Tier 2 - Risk Informed
Tier 3 - Repeatable
Tier 4 - Adaptive (Managed and Measurable)


Progression - Informal, Ad hoc response -> Agile, risk-informed and continuously improving

Action Plan 
- Understand Current State
- Determine Future State Goals
- Assessment using CSF profiles
- Determine Current and Target Tiers
- Gap Analysis and Remediation
- Continuous Improvement
