# Information Security Assurance
----
Reading NIST 800-12

Information assurance is the degree of confidence one has that security measures protect and defend info and ys by ensuring sys availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. 

## 2 Categories of Assurance
1) Design and subsequent implementation of assurance.
2) Operational assurance (further categorized into audits and monitoring).

## Design and Implementation Assurance
----
new and tech upgrade begin during the planning phase of the system life cycle.

building out tech standards addresses a system design, features, apps, components that will meet security requirements and specifications.

## Operational Assurance
----
- Addresses whether the system's technical features are being bypassed or have vulnerabilities and whether required procedures are followed.
- does not address changes to system security requirements. which could have been caused by  a change in the system and its operating or threat monitor.

  To make effective risk-based decisions, it’s essential to have reliable and current information about safeguards. Here’s a breakdown of what to evaluate:

1. **Technical Features**
    
    - Verify if technical safeguards function as intended.
    - Assess the effectiveness and reliability of these features in mitigating risks.
2. **Operational Policies and Practices**
    
    - Ensure systems operate according to documented policies and practices.
    - Regularly review these operational guidelines for alignment with security goals.
3. **Overall Security**
    
    - Identify any threats or vulnerabilities that may bypass existing safeguards.
    - Conduct thorough threat assessments to understand where safeguards may be lacking.
4. **Remaining Risk**
    
    - Evaluate residual risk, the remaining risk after safeguards are applied.
    - Determine if this risk level is within acceptable limits for the organization.

Having up-to-date information on each of these areas supports confident, informed decision-making on security matters.


## Methods to Maintain Operational Assurance
----
3 primary methods to maintain operational assurance
1) System Assessment
      - is an event or a continuous process evaluating security. Can vary in scope: my examine an entire sys for authorization or investigate a single anomalous event. 
  2) System Audit
      - This is an independant review and exam of records and activities to assess the adequacy of system controls and to ensure compliance w/ established policies and operational procedures.
  3) System Monitoring
      - Process for maintaining ongoing awareness of info Sec, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decision.
