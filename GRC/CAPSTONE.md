### Interviews
----
What procedures do you have in place to integrate cybersecurity awareness from the moment a new employee joins the company?
  - Everyone undergoes security awareness training as part of their onboarding process. Also have ongoing training programs and simulated phishing to keep security top of mind for our staff. 

How do you ensure your network security controls remain effective against emerging threats?
- Regularly update firewalls and IDS rules, also conduct continuous monitoring. We also do vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential weakness

How do you handle compliance w/ data protection regulations?
  - We accomplish regular audits

Explain your data breach response procedures.
- Immediate containment, assessment, notification to authorities and affected individuals, and post-incident analysis to prevent future occurrences. 

Describe how your cybersecurity strategy aligns w/ the orgs broader obj and risk management approach?
  - our strategy is designed to support our business obj by protecting critical assets and data.

What other Risk assessments do you do?
- recently started conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential threats and implement controls accordingly. This includes a blend of technical measures, employee training, and incident response planning.
### Test
----
Configuration and Compliance Review
  - Consists of identifying inadequate security settings and determining the process an org uses to secure its systems
Penetration Test
  - Focus on "How could a malicious hacker gain unauthorized access"
Physical Security Assessment
  - Checks the physical controls in place, from public spaces outside the org's control to the most protected physical location
Social Engineering Test
  - Determine how  well an org trains its staff on IS threats and who in an org is particularly vulnerable to being socially engineered
Vulnerability Scan
  -  Demonstrates active technical vulnerabilities as well as an org's process for managing vulnerabilities. 


## Capturing Evidence in the CSF Profile

CSF outcome statements describe how a particular information security control should be implemented

This section is where we will document what our findings for the current assessment are.

This section is used to set expectations for future IS controls and to help plan actions to improve the implementation of IS controls. 


# Phase 3 Assessment Reporting
## Writing the Assessment Report
----
Findings are assessor statements that describe whether security and privacy controls are properly employed. 
Findings will include a determination statement
  - Satisfied
  - Other than satisfied
  - Met
  - Not Met
  - Implemented
  - Not Implemented
  - etc...

## How to write a Recommendation
----
How to resolve the gaps identified in an assessment is written in the recommendation area. 

Some frameworks/standards the auditor can not give recommendations as this would be considered advising or consulting. There may be a requirements for the auditor to maintain separation from how controls are implemented.

Balance providing clear instructions with also providing instructions that the company can actually follow. 

Examples:
- Document formal job descriptions that align with key information security, compliance, and privacy roles. Ensure specific responsibilities are authorities are defined. 
- Implement mandatory employee acknowledgement of the AUP. This will confirm the identification documentation, and effective implementation of rules for acceptable use and procedures for handling information and other associated assets.
- Establish a formal process to include threat intelligence in day-to-day security operations.

# Q & A
What Tier to choose?
  two pieces of evidence that you will support the tier you choose.
    1) The Client findings field in the assessment (think of this as the interview-like answers that PGI gave in response to each of the controls), 
    2) The documents that can be viewed in the assessment (sometimes you will find parts of policies that speak directly to controls, while other times you will find gaps in what should be included in the policies).





# Notes
-----
CSF - No assessment standards
CSF Says - Controls that should be in place
