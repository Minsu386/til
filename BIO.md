I am an IT Specialist and Air Force veteran, troubleshooting my way through life. I was drawn to this field after being diagnosed with cancer and spending a lot of time in the hospital. When I saw many nurses and doctors struggling with technological issues, I began my journey into Computer Science. With an end goal that I would have the skills to be able to help people in similar situations. I am highly motivated and always seeking new opportunities to advance my understanding of current and upcoming technologies.

I am seeking new opportunities where I can leverage my determination and desire to solve challenging problems to make meaningful contributions to my community.

Proficient in full-stack development, including but not limited to JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, API, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Node. 

Outside of tech life, I like to read manga, go hiking and biking with my wife and dogs, and play video games.
