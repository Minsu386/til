One of the main uses of networks is for file- and printer-sharing. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you will often need to configure network shares. It is important that you configure the correct permissions on shares, understanding how share and NTFS permissions interact.

# Workgroup Setup
----

As well as user management, the network model determines how shared resources are administered. A **workgroup** is a peer-to-peer network model in which computers can share resources, but management of each resource is performed on the individual computers. A **domain** is based on a client/server model that groups computers together for security and to centralize administration. Some computers are designated as servers that host resources, while others are designated as clients that access resources. Administration of the servers and clients is centralized.

### Joining a Workgroup

Windows setup automatically configures membership of the default workgroup, named WORKGROUP. Each computer is identified in the network browser by a hostname. The hostname can be changed using the **System** **Properties** dialog (sysdm.cpl).

*The workgroup name can be changed via System Properties, but it is entirely cosmetic. It is almost always left set to WORKGROUP.*

### Network Discovery and File Sharing

Within a workgroup, the network type must normally be dset to Private to make the computer discoverable and allow sharing. If the network type is Public, a notification will display in File Explorer when the Network object is selected. You can use this notification to make the network private. You can also change the network type via Network & Internet settings.

*It is possible to enable discovery and sharing on public networks, but this will apply to all public networks and so is not recommended.*

Sharing options are configured via the **Advanced sharing settings** applet in Control Panel. To share files on the network, **Turn on** **network discovery** and **Turn on file and printer sharing** must both be selected.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020163929.png)

Under **All networks**, you can select **Turn off password-protected sharing** to allow anyone to access file shares configured on the local computer without entering any credentials. This works by enabling the Guest user account for network access only.

*For password-protected sharing, network users must have an account configured on the local machine. This is one of the drawbacks of workgroups compared to domains. Either you configure accounts for all users on all machines and manage passwords on each machine manually, use a single shared account for network access (again, configured on all machines), or you disable security entirely.*

*Windows also supports nearby sharing. This refers to sharing data between a PC and smartphone or another device over Bluetooth in a personal area network (PAN). This is a simple way to exchange files between devices. Files are saved to the user’s Downloads folder.*

# File Share Configuration
----

Simply enabling file sharing does not make any **resources** available. To do that, you need to configure a file share.

In a workgroup, you can enable Public folder sharing to make a shared resource available quickly. The public folder is a directory that all users of the computer can read and write to. This can be shared over the network by selecting the option under **Advanced sharing settings > All networks > Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the Public folders**.

To share a specific folder, right-click it and select **Give access to**. Select an account, and then set the **Permission level** to **Read** or **Read/write** as appropriate.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164027.png)
*Configuring a file share*

*Everyone is a special system group that contains all user accounts. This system group is often used to configure shares.*

The **Share** tab in the folder’s Properties dialog can be used to customize permissions, change the share name, and limit the number of simultaneous connections. Windows desktop versions are limited to 20 inbound connections.

In addition to any local shares created by a user, Windows automatically creates hidden administrative shares. These include the root folder of any local drives (C$) and the system folder (ADMIN$). Administrative shares can only be accessed by members of the local Administrators group.

*Note that if you disable password-protected sharing, the administrative shares remain password-protected.*


# Network Browsing and Mapping Drive
----

On both workgroup and domain networks, shares are listed by the **file server** computer under the Network object in File Explorer. Each computer is identified by its hostname. You can browse shares by opening the computer icons. Any network-enabled devices such as wireless displays, printers, smartphones, and router/modems are also listed here.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164201.png)

### Mapped Drives

A **mapped drive** is a share that has been assigned to a drive letter on a client device. To map a share as a drive, right-click it and select **Map Network Drive**. Select a drive letter and keep **Reconnect at sign-in** checked unless you want to map the drive temporarily. The drive will now show up under This PC. To remove a mapped drive, right-click it and select **Disconnect**.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164224.png)
### net use Commands

There are several net and net use command utilities that you can use to view and configure shared resources on a Windows network. A few of the commands are provided here, but you can view the full list by entering net /?

- Display a list of servers on the local network:

`net view`

- View the shares available on server named MYSERVER:

`net view \\MYSERVER`

- Map the DATA folder on MYSERVER to the M: drive:

`net use M: \\MYSERVER\DATA /persistent:yes`

- Remove the M: drive mapping:

`net use M: /delete`

- Remove all mapped drives:

`net use * /delete`

# Printer Sharing
----

Many print devices come with an integrated Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi adapter. This means that they can communicate directly on the network. Such a printer can be installed using the Add Printer wizard (from Devices and Printers). Just enter the IP address or hostname of the printer to connect to it. Each computer on the network can connect to this type of printer independently.

Any printer object set up on a Windows host can also be shared so that other network users can access it. This means that the printer can only be accessed when the Windows machine is on. Print jobs and permissions are managed via the Windows host.

A printer is shared on the network via the **Sharing** tab in its **Printer Properties** dialog. Check **Share this printer** and enter a descriptive name. Optionally, use the **Additional drivers** button to make drivers available for different client operating systems. For example, if the print server is Windows 10 64-bit, you can make 32-bit Windows 7 drivers available for other client devices.

To connect to a shared printer, open the server object from Network and the printer will be listed. Right-click it and select **Connect**.

# NTFS vs Share Permissions
----

When sharing a folder, the basic **Give access to** interface conceals some of the complexity of the Windows **NTFS versus share** permissions system:

- Share-level permissions only apply when a folder is accessed over a network connection. They offer no protection against a user who is logged on locally to the computer hosting the shared resource.
- NTFS permissions are applied for both network and local access and can be applied to folders and to individual files. NTFS permissions can be assigned directly to user accounts, but it is better practice to assign permissions to security groups and make users members of appropriate groups.

NTFS permissions can be configured for a file or folder using the **Security** tab in its properties dialog.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164402.png)

The Security tab shows the ACL applied to the file or folder. Each access control entry (ACE) assigns a set of permissions to a principal. A principal can either be a user account or a security group. The simple permissions are as follows:

- Read/list/execute permissions allows principals to open and browse files and folders and to run executable files.
- Write allows the principal to create files and subfolders and to append data to files.
- Modify allows the principal write permission plus the ability to change existing file data and delete files and folders.
- Full control allows all the other permissions plus the ability to change permissions and change the owner of the file or folder.

Each permission can be configured as either allow or deny. Each object has an implicit deny that prevents a principal from using a permission it has not been assigned. Explicit deny permissions are used to achieve more complex configurations.

A user may obtain multiple permissions from membership of different groups or by having permissions allocated directly to his or her account. Windows analyzes the permissions obtained from different accounts to determine the effective permissions. In this process, it is important to understand that an explicit deny overrides anything else (in most cases).

Putting explicit deny permissions to one side, the user obtains the most effective allow permissions obtained from any source. For example, if membership of a "Sales" group gives the user Read permission and membership of a "Managers" group gives the user Modify permission, the user's effective permission is Modify.

*If a user attempts to view or save a file with insufficient permissions to do so, Windows displays an Access Denied error message. The Advanced interface includes a tool that can be used to evaluate effective permissions for a given principal.*

# Permissions Inheritance
----

When folders are secured using NTFS and/or share permissions, the matter of **inheritance** needs to be considered.

The first consideration is that NTFS permissions assigned to a folder are automatically inherited by the files and subfolders created under the folder. This default inheritance behavior can be disabled via **Security > Advanced > Permission** tab, however.

*Directly assigned permissions (explicit permissions) always override inherited permissions, including "deny" inherited permissions. For example, if a parent folder specifies deny write permissions but an account is granted allow write permissions directly on a child file object, the effective permission will be to allow write access on the file object.*

The second consideration is the combination of share and NTFS permissions. The permissions design needs to account for the following factors:

- Share permissions only protect the resource when it is accessed across the network; NTFS permissions apply locally and across the network.
- Share permissions are set at the root of the share and all files and subdirectories inherit the same permissions.
- NTFS permissions inheritance is configurable and therefore is used in combination with the share permissions to provide greater flexibility; for example, to place more restrictive permissions at lower levels in the directory structure.
- If both share and NTFS permissions are applied to the same resource, the most restrictive applies when the file or folder is accessed over the network. For example, if the group "Everyone" has Read permission to a share and the "Users" group is given Modify permission through NTFS permissions, the effective permissions for a member of the "Users" group will be Read.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164455.png)

*Disk partitions using the FAT32 file system can only be protected using share permissions.*

As the interaction between these permissions is quite complex, most of the time, the shared folder permission is set to **Full Control** for either the Everyone or Authenticated Users default groups. The effective permissions are managed using NTFS security.

*The Authenticated Users system group excludes guests.*

# Domain Setup
----

When a computer is joined to a domain rather than a workgroup, it is put under the control of the domain administrators. To communicate on a domain, the computer must have its own account in the domain. This is separate from any user accounts that are allowed to sign-in.

*The Windows Home edition cannot join a domain.*

Windows does not support joining the computer to a domain during an attended installation. The computer can be joined during an unattended installation by using an answer file or script. Otherwise, you use either the **Access work or school** option in the **Account** settings app or the **System Properties** (sysdm.cpl) dialog to join a domain. The computer must be on the domain network and configured by DHCP with an appropriate IP address and DNS servers. Each domain is identified by a FQDN, such as ad.company.example, and the local computer must be able to resolve this name via DNS to join. The credentials of an account with domain admin privileges must be input to authorize the new computer account.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164551.png)

The same interfaces can be used to detach the computer and revert to workgroup use. This requires a user account that is a member of the local Administrators group.

To use services in the domain, the user must sign in to the PC using a domain account. The **Other user** option in the sign-in screen will provide a domain option if it is not the default. You can also enter a username in the format _Domain\Username_ to specify a domain login.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164603.png)

*Conversely, when a machine is joined to a domain, .\Username or hostname\username will authenticate against a local user account.*

# Home Folders
----

On a domain, data storage and PC configuration should be as centralized as possible so that they can be more easily monitored and backed up. This means that user data should be stored on file servers rather than on local client computers. Various settings in Active Directory can be used to redirect user profile data to network storage.

A **home folder** is a private drive mapped to a network share in which users can store personal files. The home folder location is configured via the account properties on the **Profile** tab using the Connect to box. Enter the share in the form `\\SERVER\HOME$\%USERNAME%`, where `\\SERVER\HOME$` is a shared folder created with the appropriate permissions to allow users to read and write their own subfolder only.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164710.png)
*When the user signs in, the home folder appears under This PC with the allocated drive letter*

When the user signs in, the home folder appears under This PC with the allocated drive letter:
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020164747.png)

# Roaming Profiles and Folder redirection
----

The home folders feature predates the design of modern Windows user profiles, and it can require extra user training to develop the habit of using it. Most users expect to save personal files in their profile folders: Documents, Pictures, Downloads, and so on. For users who work on more than one computer, they will have separate profiles on each computer, and the data files stored on the first computer will not be available on the second computer. This issue can be mitigated by implementing roaming profiles and/or folder redirection:

- **Roaming profiles** copies the whole profile from a share at logon and copies the updated profile back at logoff. Roaming profiles are enabled by entering the path to a share in the **Profile** path box in the general form `\\SERVER\ROAMING$\%USERNAME%`. The main drawback is that if a profile contains a lot of large data files, there will be a big impact on network bandwidth and sign-in and sign-out performance will be slow.
- **Folder redirection** changes the target of a personal folder, such as the Documents folder, Pictures folder, or Start Menu folder, to a file share. The redirected folder is only available across the network. This can be used independently or in conjunction with roaming profiles. Folder redirection is configured via a GPO.

# Review Windows Shares
----

1. What are the prerequisites for joining a computer to a domain?

The computer must be running a supported edition of Windows (Pro, Enterprise, or Education). The PC must be configured with an appropriate IP address and have access to the domain DNS servers. An account with domain administrative credentials must be used to authorize the join operation.

2. You receive a call from a user trying to save a file and receiving an "Access Denied" error. Assuming a normal configuration with no underlying file corruption, encryption, or malware issue, what is the cause and what do you suggest? 

The user does not have "Write" or "Modify" permission to that folder. If there is no configuration issue, you should advise the user about the storage locations permitted for user-generated files. If there were a configuration issue, you would investigate why the user had not been granted the correct permissions for the target folder.

3. What is the significance of a $ symbol at the end of a share name?

The share is hidden from the file browser. It can be accessed by typing a UNC. The default administrative shares are all configured as hidden.

4. When you set NTFS permissions on a folder, what happens to the files and subfolders by default?

They inherit the parent folder's permissions.

5. If a user obtains Read permissions from a share and Deny Write from NTFS permissions, can the user view files in the folder over the network?

Yes (but he or she cannot create files).

6. A user is assigned Read NTFS permissions to a resource via his user account and Full Control via membership of a group. What effective NTFS permissions does the user have for the resource?

Full control—the most effective permissions are applied.

Windows supports many types of network connection, from wired and wireless adapters to using cellular radios or remote links. While they use different underlying hardware and signaling methods, each needs to be configured with standard protocols, clients, and services. In this topic you will learn how to configure properties for each of these network connection types.

# Windows Network Connection Types
----

A computer joins a local network by connecting the network adapter—or network interface card (NIC)—to a switch or wireless access point. For proper end user device configuration, the card settings should be configured to match the capabilities of the network appliance.

### Establish a Wired Network Connection

Almost all **wired** network connections are based on some type of Ethernet. The adapter's media type must match that of the switch it is connected to. Most use copper wire cable with RJ45 jacks, though installations in some corporate networks may use fiber optic cabling and connector types. The adapter and switch must also use the same Ethernet settings. These are usually set to autonegotiate, and a link will be established as soon as the cable is plugged in.

Under Windows, each wired adapter is assigned a name. The first adapter is labelled Ethernet. Additional adapters are identified as Ethernet2, Ethernet3, and so on. A new name can be applied if necessary. If any Ethernet settings do need to be configured manually, locate the adapter in **Device Manager**, right-click and select **Properties**, and then update settings using the **Advanced** tab. You can also access adapter options via the status page in **Network & Internet** settings.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020165027.png)

### Establish a Wireless Network Connection

To **establish a wireless network connection**, select the network status icon in the notification area, and select from the list of displayed networks. If the access point is set to broadcast the network name or service set ID (SSID), then the network will appear in the list of available networks. The bars show the strength of the signal, and the lock icon indicates whether the network uses encryption. To connect, select the network, and then enter the required credentials. If you choose the **Connect automatically** option, Windows will use the network without prompting whenever it is in range.

If SSID broadcast is suppressed, input WLAN settings manually. From the **Network & Internet** page, select **Wi-Fi > Manage known networks > Add a new network**.

Wi-Fi properties for the adapter are configured via Device Manager. The most important setting on a wireless card is support for the 802.11 standard supported by the access point. Most cards are set to support any standard available. This means that a card that supports 802.11n will also be able to connect to 802.11g and 802.11b networks. You can also adjust parameters such as roaming aggressiveness and transmit power to address connection issues.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020165041.png)

# IP Addressing Schemes ( went over 1101 Optional )
----

Device Manager properties are for the adapter’s low-level network link (Ethernet or Wi-Fi). To connect to a network, the logical adapter must have a valid **client network configuration**. Each adapter must be configured with client software and allocated an appropriate IP address and **subnet mask**. 

### Internet Protocol Addressing Scheme

An Internet Protocol (IP) addressing scheme uses these values:

- In IPv4, the 32-bit address is combined with a 32-bit subnet mask, both of which are typically entered in dotted decimal notation. The mask distinguishes logical network and host portions within the IP address. For example, the address 192.168.1.100 and mask 255.255.255.0 mean that the host is using the address portion .100 on the logical network 192.168.1.0.
- In IPv6, the address is 128 bits long and the interface address portion is always the last 64 bits. Network prefixes are used to identify logical networks within the first 64 bits.

All hosts on the same local network must use addresses from within the same range. Hosts with addresses in different ranges can only be contacted by forwarding the packet via a router. Each host must be configured with the IP address of a local router. This is referred to as the default gateway.

	*The router interface is usually assigned the first available value. For example, if the IP address scheme is 192.168.1.0/24, the first available host address is 192.168.1.1.*

Typically, a host is also configured with the addresses of **Domain Name System (DNS)** servers that can resolve requests for name resources to IP addresses, making identification of hosts and services simpler.

	On a home network, the router is usually configured to forward DNS queries, so the gateway and primary DNS server parameters for client PCs will usually be set to the same value.

As well as DNS servers, the host might be configured with a **domain suffix** to identify its fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the local network. For example, if attached to a network identified as ad.company.example, the FQDN of PC1 will be PC1.ad.company.example.

### Static versus Dynamic Configuration

These IP values can be assigned **statically or dynamically**. Configuring large numbers of hosts with a valid static addressing parameters is a complex management task. Most hosts are configured to obtain an address automatically, using a service called the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).


# Windows Client Configuration
----

The IP configuration for each adapter interface is often set using the GUI Properties dialog accessed via Network & Internet settings or the Network Connections applet (ncpa.cpl). By default, the following clients, protocols, and services are installed on Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters:

- Client for Microsoft Networks and File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks software.
- **Internet Protocol**—Both IP version 4 and IP version 6 will be installed. The network adapter automatically uses the appropriate version of the protocol depending on the network it is connected to.
- **Link-layer Topology Discovery**—This protocol provides network mapping and discovery functions for networks without dedicated name servers.

The IP properties will default to **Obtain an IP address automatically**, which uses a DHCP server. To configure a static address, double-click the IP properties item.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020165827.png)

You can also adjust the IP configuration via the settings app. In this dialog, you need to enter the mask as a prefix length in bits. A 255.255.255.0 mask is 24 bits.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020165837.png)
*Using Network & Internet settings to configure static addressing. In this dialog, you need to enter the mask as a prefix length rather than a dotted decimal mask*


# Network Location
----

Each network connection is governed by the **local OS firewall settings** imposed by Windows Defender Firewall.

When you connect to a new network, the Network Location Awareness (NLA) service prompts you to set the network type. If the network type is set as Public, Windows Firewall is configured to block all access and make the host undiscoverable. If the network is set as Private, the firewall settings allow host discovery and folder/printer sharing.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171216.png)

	There is also a Domain profile. You cannot choose this option, but if the computer is joined to a domain, then the firewall policy will be configured via Group Policy.

Use Network & Internet settings to change the location defined for a network.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171234.png)
*Using Network & Internet Settings to change the network profile*

With network discovery enabled, other computers and devices can be accessed via the **Network object in File Explorer**. Windows uses a system called universal naming convention (UNC) syntax to address network hosts and resources. The syntax for a UNC **network path** is \\_Host_\_Path_, where _Host_ is the host name, FQDN, or IP address of the server and _Path_ is a shared folder or file path.

# Windows Defender Firewall Configuration
----

You can turn the firewall on or off and access the configuration applets shown via the **Firewall & network protection** page in the Windows Defender Security Center or via the Windows Defender Firewall applet in Control Panel. You can also choose to block all incoming connections.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171321.png)

To allow or block programs (configure exceptions), from the **Windows Firewall** status page, select **Allow an app through the firewall**. Check the box for either or both network profile types or use **Allow another program** to locate its executable file and add it to the list.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171331.png)

# VPN and WWAN Connection Types
----

Wired and wireless adapters connect to local networks, but there are other network types too. Many corporate networks allow devices to connect remotely, to support home workers, field workers, branch offices, partners, suppliers, and customers. Also, a user might need or prefer to use a cellular adapter for Internet access.

### Establish a Virtual Private Network Connection

A **virtual private network (VPN)** connects the components and resources of two (private) networks over another (public) network. A VPN is a "tunnel" through the Internet (or any other public network). It uses special connection protocols and encryption technology to ensure that the tunnel is secure and that the user is properly authenticated. Once the connection has been established, to all intents and purposes, the remote computer becomes part of the local network (though it is still restricted by the bandwidth available over the WAN link).

Windows supports several VPN types. If the VPN type is supported, you can configure a connection using the Windows client from Network & Internet settings. Some VPNs might require use of third-party client software.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171622.png)

Subsequently, the network connection will be available via the network status icon. Right-click the icon and select the VPN connection icon to **Connect** or **Disconnect** or modify the connection's Properties.

### Establish a Wireless Wide Area Network Connection

Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) refers to using a cellular adapter to connect to the Internet via a provider's network. The bandwidth depends on the technologies supported by the adapter and by the local cell tower (3G, 4G, or 5G, for instance).

The WWAN adapter can be fitted as a USB device or as an internal adapter. For GSM and 4G or 5G services, the adapter must also be fitted with a subscriber identity module (SIM) card issued by the network provider. You can enable or disable the connection using the network status icon and configure it via Network & Internet settings.

Cellular providers can impose high charges if the subscriber’s data allowance is exceeded. You can define the network type as metered and set a data limit within Windows to avoid the risk of exceeding the provider’s cap. You can also monitor data usage by each app.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171636.png)

# Proxy Settings
----

Some networks use a proxy to provide network connectivity. A proxy server can improve both performance and security. Client PCs pass Internet requests to the proxy server, which forwards them to the Internet. The proxy may also cache pages and content that is requested by multiple clients, reducing bandwidth.

An intercepting or transparent proxy does not require any client configuration and some proxies are autoconfiguring. If neither of these cases apply, each client must be configured with the IP address and TCP port to use to forward traffic via the proxy. These **proxy settings** are configured via Network & Internet settings.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020171656.png)

# Review Windows Networking
----

1. You are assisting a user with configuring a static IP address. The user has entered the following configuration values and now cannot access the Internet. Is there a configuration issue or a different problem?

- IP: 192.168.1.1
- Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 192.168.1.0
- DNS: 192.168.1.0

There is a configuration problem. 192.168.1.0 is not a host address. With the subnet mask 255.255.255.0, it identifies the network range as 192.168.1.0/24. The gateway is usually configured as the first available host address in this range: 192.168.1.1. The DNS server should also be set to 192.168.1.1.

2. You are assisting another user who is trying to configure a static IP on a Windows workstation. The user says that 255.255.255.0 is not being accepted in the prefix length box. Should the user open a different dialog to complete the configuration or enter a different value?

The Network & Interface settings Edit IP settings dialog can be used. 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask in dotted decimal format. The dialog just requires the number of mask bits. Each “255” in a dotted decimal mask represents 8 bits, so the user should enter 24.

3. You are supporting a user who has just replaced a wireless router. The user has joined the new wireless network successfully but can no longer find other computers on the network. What should you check first?

Use Network & Internet to check the network profile type. When the network changed, the user probably selected the wrong option at the prompt to allow the PC to be discoverable, and the profile is probably set to Public. Change the type Private. 

4. True or false? Windows Defender Firewall cannot be disabled.

False. It is not usually a good idea to do so, but it can be disabled via Security Center or the Control Panel applet.

5. You need to set up a VPN connection on a user’s Windows laptop. The VPN type is IKEv2. What other information, if any, do you need to configure the connection?

You must also input the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address of the remote access VPN server.
