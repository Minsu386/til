Windows 10 and Windows 11 represent the currently supported versions of the Windows client OS. However, while these versions are used for marketing, they actually cover a variety of subtly different OSs. For one thing, Windows is released in editions, each distinguished by support for features that target particular market sectors, such as corporate versus home. Additionally, there have been several iterations of Windows 10, referred to as feature updates. As an A+ technician, you must be able to summarize and compare these differences so that you can provide proper support and advice to your users.

# Windows Versions
----

Windows has been released in several versions over the years. A new version may introduce significant changes in the desktop style and user interface, add new features, and add support for new types of hardware. 

## **32-bit Versus 64-bit**

Each version and edition of Windows 10 was originally available as 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) software. A 32-bit CPU can only run the 32-bit editions. A 64-bit CPU can run either. All 32-bit Windows editions are limited to 4 GB system memory. 64-bit editions all support much more RAM but have different limits for licensing purposes.

64-bit editions of Windows can run most 32-bit applications software, though there may be some exceptions (you should check with the software vendor). The reverse is not true, however; a 32-bit version of Windows cannot run 64-bit applications software. 64-bit editions of Windows also require 64-bit hardware device drivers authorized ("signed") by Microsoft. If the vendor has not produced a 64-bit driver, the hardware device will not be usable.

*Windows 10 with feature update 2004 and later supports 64-bit only. Windows 11 is 64-bit only.*

## Desktop Styles

The Windows user interface (UI) is based around the desktop, Start menu, taskbar, and notification area elements. These basic desktop style elements have remained in place, but Windows versions and feature updates sometimes introduce major and minor changes. There are frequent changes to the design of the Start menu, for instance, including its brief expansion into a screen with live app tiles. As another example, feature update 1607 introduced support for dark themes, and subsequent updates have tweaked the way dark versus light themes can be configured.

Windows 11 makes several changes to the desktop style. Notably, it center-aligns the taskbar and introduces yet another design for the Start menu. There is also better support for multiple desktops. You might use multiple desktops to separate work documents and apps from games and personal documents.

# Windows Home Edition
----

The Windows Home edition is designed for domestic consumers and possibly small office home office (SOHO) business use. Windows 10 Home does not have any unique features, and it has fewer features than other editions. Notably, the Home edition cannot be used to join a Windows domain network.

The main management tasks for Windows Home are configuring secure use by family members and simple file sharing of picture, music, and video files in a workgroup network with other Windows computers and smart home devices, such as smart speakers and TVs. Many home computers are also configured to play games.

*Windows 11 has the same editions as Windows 10.*

## Windows Home Licensing

Windows Home supports two licensing models:

An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) license means that the OS is pre-installed to a PC or laptop and is valid for that device only. The computer vendor is responsible for support. Most new devices will support upgrading the license to Windows 11.
A retail license may be transferred between computers, though it can only be installed on a single device at any one time. A retail license is supported by Microsoft and comes with Windows 11 upgrade rights.

## Windows Home System Limitations

Windows Home does not support the use of multiple CPUs, though it does support multicore (up to 64 cores) and HyperThreading. The 64-bit edition is restricted to 128 GB RAM. 



# Windows Work and Education Edition
----

Other editions of Windows are designed for use at work and in education:

- Windows Pro is designed for small- and medium-size businesses and can be obtained using OEM, retail, or volume licensing. This "Professional" edition comes with management features designed to allow network administrators more control over each client device. There is also a Pro for Workstations edition with support for more advanced hardware.
- Windows Enterprise has the full feature set but is only available via volume licensing.
- Windows Education/Pro Education are variants of the Enterprise and Pro editions designed for licensing by schools and colleges.

The principal distinguishing feature of the Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions is the ability to join a domain network.


In a workgroup network, the PCs and laptops can share data and communicate, but each machine and its user account database are managed separately.

On a corporate network, it is necessary to manage user accounts and system policies centrally because there are more machines to administer, and security requirements are higher. This centralized management is provided by joining each computer to a domain, where the accounts are configured on Domain Controller (DC) servers.

Some other notable features of the Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions are as follows:

- Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) is used to create and apply OS and software application settings. These could be configured on each machine individually, but more typically they are applied via policies configured on the DC so that client machines have uniform desktop styles and settings. The editor is not available in the Home edition.
- BitLocker enables the user to encrypt all the information on a disk drive. Encryption means that data on the device is protected even if someone steals it (as long as they cannot crack the user password). BitLocker is not supported in Windows Home edition.

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) allows a user to connect to the machine and operate it over a network. While the Home edition has the RDP client software, it does not support an RDP server.


# Windows Pro and Enterprise Edition
----

Like Windows Home, Windows Pro is available as an OEM or retail/full packaged product (FPP) license. It can also be obtained via a volume licensing program. Volume licensing allows the customer to obtain discounts by specifying a bulk number of devices or users. It also allows for the creation of custom installation images for rapid deployment.

Windows Pro for Workstations has the same features as Pro but supports more maximum RAM and advanced hardware technologies, such as persistent system RAM (NVDIMM).

Windows Enterprise and Education editions are only available via volume licensing. The Enterprise edition has several features that are not available in the Pro edition, such as support for Microsoft’s DirectAccess virtual private networking technology, AppLocker software execution control, and the management and monitoring feature Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.

The Pro/Enterprise/Education editions of Windows have less restrictive hardware limits than those of the Home edition. They all support computers with multiple processors:

- Pro and Education editions support 2-way multiprocessing and up to 128 cores.
- Pro for Workstations and Enterprise editions support 4-way multiprocessing and up to 256 cores.
They have the following system RAM support limitations:

- Pro and Education editions are restricted to 2 TB.
- 
- 
- 
- 
- Pro for Workstations and Enterprise editions are restricted to 6 TB.


# Windows Upgrade Path and Feature Updates
----

An in-place upgrade means that the setup program for the new version is launched from within the current OS. The applications, configuration settings, and data files should all be preserved as  long as they are compatible with the new version.

*Before performing an upgrade, you can run a compatibility advisor tool. Any software and hardware devices that will not be compatible with the new version should be uninstalled before performing the upgrade.*

## Upgrade Paths

If you are considering an in-place upgrade, you must check that the current OS version is supported as an upgrade path to the intended version. The OS vendor should publish supported upgrade paths on its website. For example, the upgrade paths for Windows 10 are published here: docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-upgrade-paths.

With Windows, you also have to consider the edition when upgrading. You can usually upgrade to the same or higher edition (Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home or Pro or Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro, for instance), but you cannot upgrade from a Home to an Enterprise edition. Downgrading the edition is supported in some circumstances (Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Home, for instance), but this only retains documents and other data, not apps and settings. Downgrading from an Enterprise edition is not supported.

## Feature Updates

Feature updates for Windows 10 are identified with a name and number. For example, in July 2016, Microsoft released a Windows 10 feature update called Windows 10 Anniversary Update. This release was identified with the number 1607, which corresponds to the year (2016) and month (07/July) of release. The current version of Windows 10 at the time of writing is 21H2, released in the second half of 2021.

In addition to feature updates, Windows is updated periodically with quality updates. Quality updates do not usually make radical changes to Windows, though some do include new features. Quality updates might sometimes cause compatibility problems with some hardware devices and software applications, but this is less likely than with feature updates.



# Review
----
1. In terms of system hardware, what is the main advantage of a 64-bit version of Windows?

Support for more than 4 GB RAM.

2. You are advising a business that needs to provision video-editing workstations with 4-way multiprocessing. Which retail Windows edition will allow them to make full use of this hardware?

Windows Pro for Workstations supports 4-way multiprocessing (four CPUs installed to separate sockets) and up to 6 TB RAM. Windows Enterprise has the same hardware limits but is not available via a retail channel.

3. You are advising a customer whose business is expanding. The business owner needs to provision an additional 30 desktop computers, some of which will be installed at a second office location. The business is currently run with a workgroup network of five Windows 7 Home Premium desktop computers and one file server. Why might you suggest licenses for an edition of Windows 10 that supports corporate needs for the new computers and has upgrades for the old computers? Which specific edition(s) could you recommend?

Without a domain, accounts must be configured on each computer individually. With more than 30 computers to manage at two locations, this would be a substantial task, so switching to a domain network, where the accounts can be configured on the server, is likely to save costs in the long term. You can suggest either Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise for use on a domain.

# Summary
----

You should be able to explain differences between OS types, versions, and editions to identify a suitable choice of OS for a given scenario.

### Guidelines for Supporting Operating Systems

Follow these guidelines to support use of multiple operating system types in a home or business environment:

- Establish requirements for workstation (Windows, Linux, macOS, Chrome OS) and cell phone/tablet (iOS, iPadOS, Android) operating systems given devices used in the environment.
- Ensure that an appropriate edition is selected when deploying Windows:
- 32-bit versus 64-bit support.
- RAM and CPU limits between Home, Pro, Pro for Workstations, and Enterprise editions.
- Features supported by Pro that are not available in Home (RDP server, BitLocker, gpedit.msc) and features supported by Enterprise editions that are not available in Pro.
- OEM, retail, and/or volume-licensing availability.
- Monitor vendor life-cycle policies (update limitations and EOL announcements) to plan OS and device upgrade and replacement cycles.
- Plan for compatibility concerns between operating systems, including filesystem formats (NTFS, FAT32, ext3/ext4, APFS, exFAT), software, networking, and user training/education on different desktop styles.
