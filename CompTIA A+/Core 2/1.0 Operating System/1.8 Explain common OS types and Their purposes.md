As an IT professional, being familiar with the different types of operating systems can help you to support a variety of computer and mobile device environments. In this topic, you will identify the types of PC and mobile device operating systems plus features such as file system and life-cycle support.

# Windows and macOS
----

The market for operating systems is divided into four mainstream types:

- **Business client**—An OS designed to work as a client in centrallymanaged business domain networks.
- **Network Operating System (NOS)**—An OS designed to run servers in business networks.
- **Home client**—An OS designed to work as a standalone machine or in a workgroup network in a home or small office.
- **Cell phone (smartphone)/Tablet**—An OS designed to work with a handheld portable device. This type of OS must have a touch-operated interface.

	`A business client PC is sometimes generically referred to as a workstation. Most hardware vendors use workstation to mean a powerful PC, however, such as one used for graphics design, video editing, or software development.`

### Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows covers all four of the market segments:

- Windows 10 and Windows 11 are released in different editions to support business workstation and home PC use. They support a touch interface for use on tablets and laptops (attempts to produce Windows smartphones have been abandoned, however).
- Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022 are optimized for use as NOSs. They share the same underlying code and desktop interface as the client versions, however.

### Apple macOS

macOS is only supplied with Apple-built workstations (Apple Mac desktops and Apple iMac all-in-ones) and laptops (Apple MacBooks). You cannot purchase macOS and install it on an ordinary PC. This helps to make macOS stable but does mean that there is far less choice in terms of buying extra hardware.

macOS is re-developed from the kernel of another type of operating system called UNIX. This kernel is supplemented with additional code to implement the Mac's graphical interface and system utilities. macOS supports the Magic Trackpad touch input device, but there is no support for touch screens.

macOS gets periodic version updates that are released to Mac owners at no cost. At the time of writing, supported versions are 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur), and 12 (Monterey). As there is a tight link between the models of Mac computers and the OS, Apple makes specific limitations about whether a new version of macOS can be installed to a Mac computer. Check [support.apple.com](https://support.apple.com/) for the technical specification for any particular macOS release.


# UNIX, Linux, and Chrome OS
----

Windows and macOS dominate the desktop/workstation/laptop market, but a third "family" of *nix operating systems is very widely used on a larger range of devices.

### UNIX

UNIX is a trademark for a family of operating systems originally developed at Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s. All UNIX systems share a kernel/shell architecture. The kernel is the low-level code that mediates access to system resources (CPU, RAM, and input/output devices) for other processes installed under the OS. Interchangeable shells run on the kernel to provide the user interface. Unlike Windows and macOS, UNIX is portable to a huge range of different hardware platforms; versions of UNIX can run on everything from personal computers to mainframes and on many types of computer processors.

### Linux

Originally developed by Linus Torvalds, Linux is a fully open-source OS kernel, derived from UNIX. As with other operating systems, the Linux kernel is bundled with multiple additional features, such as a shell command interpreter, desktop window environment, and app packages. Unlike Windows and macOS, there are lots of different Linux distributions (distros), with each maintaining its own set of packages. Examples of notable distros include SUSE, Red Hat, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, and Arch. Distros can use different licensing and support options. For example, SUSE and Red Hat are subscription-based, while Ubuntu is free to install but has paid-for enterprise support contracts, and Fedora, Debian, Mint, and Arch are community supported.

[distro-family-tree.png (2320×26400) (distrowatch.com)](https://distrowatch.com/images/other/distro-family-tree.png)

Linux distros use one of two release models:

- The standard release model uses versioning to distinguish between updates. Some versions may be designated as long-term support (LTS), meaning that the distro owner will undertake to provide support and updates for that version for a longer period.
- The rolling release model means that updates are delivered once the distro owner considers them to be stable. There is no distinction between versions.

Linux can be used as a desktop or server OS. Apache, IBM, and Sun/Oracle are among the vendors producing end-user and server applications for Linux. As a desktop OS, Linux tends to be used in schools and universities more than in businesses or in homes. As a server OS, it dominates the market for web servers. It is also used very widely as the OS for "smart" appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

### Chrome OS

**Chrome OS** is derived from Linux via an open-source OS called Chromium. Chrome OS itself is proprietary. Chrome OS is developed by Google to run on specific laptop (Chromebook) and PC (Chromebox) hardware. This hardware is designed for the budget and education markets.

Chrome OS was primarily developed to use web applications. In a web application, the software is hosted on a server on the Internet, and the client connects to it using a browser. The client computer does not need to be particularly powerful as the server does most of the processing. Chrome OS provides a minimal environment compared to Windows. This means that there is less chance of some other software application or hardware device driver interfering with the function of the browser.

There are also "packaged" apps available for use offline, and Chrome OS can run apps developed for Android.

# iOS and Android
----

A cell phone/tablet OS is one that is designed to work solely with a touch-screen interface. The main OSs in this category are Apple iOS/iPadOS and Android.

### Apple iOS

**iOS** is the operating system for Apple's iPhone smartphone and original models of the iPad tablet. Like macOS, iOS is also derived from UNIX and developed as a closed-source operating system. This means that the code used to design the software is kept confidential, can only be modified by Apple, and can only be used on Apple devices.

New versions are released approximately every year, with version 15 current at the time of writing. Apple makes new versions freely available, though older hardware devices may not support all the features of a new version or may not be supported at all. As with macOS, update limitations are published at [support.apple.com](https://support.apple.com/).

### Apple iPadOS

The **iPadOS** has been developed from iOS to support the functionality of the latest iPad models (2019 and up). The principal advantage of iPadOS over iOS is better support for multitasking (using more than one app at once) and the Apple Pencil stylus device. Versions of iPadOS are released in parallel with iOS.

### AndroidTM

**Android** is a smartphone/tablet OS developed by the Open Handset Alliance, primarily driven by Google. Unlike iOS, it is an open-source OS, based on Linux. The software code is made publicly available. This means that there is more scope for hardware vendors, such as Acer, Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, Samsung, Sony, and Xiaomi to produce specific versions for their smartphone and tablet models.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020172939.png)

At the time of writing, supported Android versions range from 9 (Pie) to 12. Because handset vendors produce their own editions of Android, device compatibility for new versions is more mixed compared with iOS. End-of-life policies and update restrictions for particular handsets are determined by the handset vendor rather than any kind of overall Android authority.

# Windows File System Types
----

High-level formatting prepares a partition on a disk device for use with an operating system. The format process creates a file system on the disk partition. Each OS is associated with types of file system.

### New Technology File System

The **New Technology File System (NTFS)** is a proprietary file system developed by Microsoft for use with Windows. It provides a 64-bit addressing scheme, allowing for very large volumes and file sizes. In theory, the maximum volume size is 16 Exabytes, but actual implementations of NTFS are limited to between 137 GB and 256 Terabytes, depending on the version of Windows and the allocation unit size. The key NTFS features are:

- **Journaling**—When data is written to an NTFS volume, it is re-read, verified, and logged. In the event of a problem, the sector concerned is marked as bad and the data relocated. Journaling makes recovery after power outages and crashes faster and more reliable.
- **Snapshots**—This allows the Volume Shadow Copy Service to make read-only copies of files at given points in time even if the file is locked by another process. This file version history allows users to revert changes more easily and also supports backup operations.
- **Security**—Features such as file permissions and ownership, file access audit trails, quota management, and encrypting file system (EFS) allow administrators to ensure only authorized users can read/modify file data.
- **POSIX Compliance**—To support UNIX/Linux compatibility, Microsoft engineered NTFS to support case-sensitive naming, hard links, and other key features required by UNIX/Linux applications. Although the file system is case-sensitive capable and preserves case, Windows does not insist upon case-sensitive naming.
- **Indexing**—The Indexing Service creates a catalog of file and folder locations and properties, speeding up searches.
- **Dynamic Disks**—This disk management feature allows space on multiple physical disks to be combined into volumes.

	`_Windows Home editions do not support dynamic disks or encryption._*
`

Windows can only be installed to an NTFS-formatted partition. NTFS is also usually the best choice for additional partitions and removable drives that will be used with Windows. The only significant drawback of NTFS is that it is not fully supported by operating systems other than Windows. macOS can read NTFS drives but cannot write to them. Linux distributions and utilities may be able to support NTFS to some degree.

### FAT32

The FAT file system is a very early type named for its method of organization—the file allocation table. The FAT provides links from one allocation unit to another. **FAT32** is a variant of FAT that uses a 32-bit allocation table, nominally supporting volumes up to 2 TB. The maximum file size is 4 GB minus 1 byte.

FAT32 does not support any of the reliability or security features of NTFS. It is typically used to format the system partition (the one that holds the boot loader). It is also useful when formatting removable drives and memory cards intended for multiple operating systems and devices.

### exFAT

exFAT is a 64-bit version of FAT designed for use with removable hard drives and flash media. Like NTFS, exFAT supports large volumes (128 petabytes) and file sizes (16 exabytes). There is also support for access permissions but not encryption.


# Linux and macOS File System Types
----

While Linux and macOS provide some degree of support for FAT32 and NTFS as removable media, they use dedicated file systems to format fixed disks.

### Linux File Systems

Most Linux distributions use some version of the extended (ext) file system to format partitions on mass storage devices. **ext3** is a 64-bit file system with support for journaling. **ext4** delivers better performance than ext3 delivers and would usually represent the best choice for new systems.

Linux can also support FAT/FAT32 (designated as VFAT). Additional protocols such as the Network File System (NFS) can be used to mount remote storage devices into the local file system.

### Apple File System

Where Windows uses NTFS and Linux typically uses ext3 or ext4, Apple Mac workstations and laptops use the proprietary **Apple File System (APFS)**, which supports journaling, snapshots, permissions/ownership, and encryption.

# OS Compatibility Issues
----

One of the major challenges of supporting a computing environment composed of devices that use different operating systems is compatibility concerns. Compatibility concerns can be considered in several categories: OS compatibility with device hardware, software app compatibility with an OS, host-to-host compatibility for exchanging data over a network, and user training requirements.

### Hardware Compatibility and Update Limitations

When you plan to install a new version of an operating system as an upgrade or replace one OS with another, you must check that your computer meets the new hardware requirements. There is always a chance that some change in a new OS version will have update limitations that make the CPU and memory technology incompatible or cause hardware device drivers written for an older version not to work properly. For example, Windows 11 requires a CPU or motherboard with support for trusted platform module (TPM) version 2. This strongly limits its compatibility with older PCs and laptops.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020173241.png)

### Software Compatibility

A software application is coded to run on a particular OS. You cannot install an app written for iOS on an Android smartphone, for instance. The developer must create a different version of the app. This can be relatively easy for the developer or quite difficult, depending on the way the app is coded and the target platforms. The app ecosystem—the range of software available for a particular OS—is a big factor in determining whether an OS becomes established in the marketplace.

### Network Compatibility

Compatibility is also a consideration for how devices running different operating systems can communicate on data networks. Devices running different operating systems cannot "talk" to one another directly. The operating systems must support common network protocols that allow data to be exchanged in a standard format.

### User Training and Support

Different desktop styles introduced by a new OS version or changing from one OS to another can generate issues as users struggle to navigate the new desktop and file system. An upgrade project must take account of this and prepare training programs and self-help resources as well as prepare technicians to provide support on the new interface.

In the business client market, upgrade limitations and compatibility concerns make companies reluctant to update to new OS versions without extensive testing. As extensive testing is very expensive, they are generally reluctant to adopt new versions without a compelling need to do so.

	`These compatibility concerns are being mitigated somewhat using web applications and cloud services. A web application only needs the browser to be compatible, not the whole OS. The main compatibility issue for a web application is supporting a touch interface and a very wide range of display resolutions on the different devices that might connect to it.`


# Vendor Life-cycle Limitations
----

A vendor life cycle describes the policies and procedures an OS developer or device vendor puts in place to support a product. Policy specifics are unique to each vendor, but the following general life-cycle phases are typical:

- A public beta phase might be used to gather user feedback. Microsoft operates a Windows Insider Program where you can sign up to use early release Windows versions and feature updates.
- During the supported phase when the product is being actively marketed, the vendor releases regular patches to fix critical security and operational issues and feature upgrades to expand OS functionality. Supported devices should be able to install OS upgrade versions.
- During the extended support phase, the product is no longer commercially available, but the vendor continues to issue critical patches. Devices that are in extended support may or may not be able to install OS upgrades.
- An end of life (EOL) system is one that is no longer supported by its developer or vendor. EOL systems no longer receive security updates and therefore represent a critical vulnerability for a company's security systems if any remain in active use.

# Review OS types
----
1. Apart from Windows and macOS, what operating system options are there for client PCs installed to a local network?

The other main choice is one of the distributions of Linux. A company might also use some sort of UNIX. Finally, Chrome OS is installed on Chromebox PCs. These are often used by educational institutions and businesses that rely primarily on web applications rather than locally installed desktop software.

2. You are advising a customer with an older-model Android smartphone. The customer wants to update to the latest version of Android, but using the update option results in a "No updates available" message. What type of issue is this, and what advice can you provide?

This is an issue with update limitations. Android is quite a fragmented market, and customers must depend on the handset vendor to implement OS updates for a particular model. The customer can only check the handset vendor's website or helpline to find out if a version update will ever be supported for that model.

3. What feature of modern file systems assists recovery after power outages or OS crash events?

Journaling means that the file system keeps a log of updates that it can use to recover damaged data. The OS might also make use of snapshot capability to maintain a file-version history or perform continuous backups.

4. A customer asks whether an iOS app that your company developed will also work on her Apple macOS computer. What issue does this raise, and what answer might you give?

The issue here is compatibility between different operating systems. Even though both are produced by Apple, iOS and macOS use different environments, so the iOS app cannot necessarily be installed directly. Your company might make a macOS version. However (do not worry if you did not include this in your answer), with the latest versions of macOS, there is support for native iOS apps, so this might be something you can offer.
