Being able to install or upgrade an operating system can be important if you have built a custom computer system from scratch, if the system you purchased from a vendor did not have the correct system installed, or if you are completely redeploying existing hardware from one system to another. The skills and information in this topic will help you plan and perform an OS installation properly, for whatever your technical and business requirements might be.

# Installation and Upgrade Considerations
----

An operating system (OS) installation copies the files from the installation media to a partition on the target computer's fixed disk. Given this basic task, there are a few installation types that have unique considerations to plan for. 

### Clean Install or In-place Upgrade

An attended installation is where the installer inputs the configuration information in response to prompts from a setup program. There are two main **types of attended installation**:

- **Clean install** means installing the OS to a new computer or completely replacing the OS software on an old one by repartitioning and reformatting the target disk. Any existing user data or settings are deleted during the setup process.
- **In-place upgrade** means running setup from an existing version of the OS so that third-party applications, user settings, and data files are all kept and made available in the new version.

A clean install is generally seen as more reliable than upgrading. In-place upgrades are generally designed for home users.

	Note that you can only upgrade the same type of operating system. You cannot "upgrade" from Windows to Linux, for instance.

### Upgrade Considerations

1. Check **hardware compatibility**—You must make sure that the CPU, chipset, and RAM components of the computer are sufficient to run the OS. PC operating systems now often require a 64-bit CPU, for example. New versions often have higher RAM requirements than older software.
2. Check **application and driver support/backward compatibility**—Most version upgrades try to maintain support for applications and device drivers that were developed for older versions. When performing an in-place upgrade, any incompatible software or hardware should be uninstalled before attempting an in-place upgrade. If the existing app or driver is not directly compatible, the vendor might have produced a new version that can be reinstalled after the upgrade. Incompatible apps and devices will have to be replaced with new alternatives.

	`Microsoft maintains a Windows Compatible Products List, previously called theHardware Compatibility List (HCL). This is a catalog of tested devices and drivers. If a device has not passed Windows logo testing, you should check the device vendor's website to confirm whether there is a driver available.`

	`You can sometimes use automated Upgrade Advisor software to check whether the existing computer hardware (and software applications) will be compatible with a new version of Windows. An Upgrade Advisor might be bundled with the setup program or available from the vendor website.`

3. **Backup files and user preferences**—For a clean install, you can use a backup to restore data and settings after OS setup has been completed. For an in-place upgrade, a security backup is essential in case the upgrade goes wrong and you need to recover data.
4. **Obtain third-party drivers**—The OS setup media might not contain drivers for certain hardware devices. This is typically only an issue where the computer uses a RAID controller. If the controller driver is not available, the setup program will not be able to use the RAID volume. You might also need to ensure that the driver for an Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter is available. 

	`Unsupported hardware or software can cause problems during an in-place upgrade and should be physically uninstalled from the PC. It is also worth obtaining the latest drivers for various devices from the vendor's website. The Windows setup media ships with default drivers for a number of products, but these are often not up to date nor are they comprehensive. Store the latest drivers for your hardware on a USB drive or network location so that you can update hardware efficiently.`

### Feature Updates

The Windows 10 and Windows 11 **product lifecycles** make use of **feature updates** to introduce changes to the desktop environment and bundled apps. These are delivered via Windows Update. While they rarely have different hardware requirements, it is best to treat a feature update in the same way as you would an in-place upgrade. Check for any hardware or software compatibility concerns and make a backup before proceeding.

# Unattended Installations
----

Performing an attended installation is time-consuming. Although the setup process has been streamlined since the early versions of Windows, an attended installation still requires the installer to monitor the setup program and input information. When it comes to large deployments (whether at the same time or over a period of months), there are several options for completing fully or partially unattended installations.

An unattended installation uses a script or configuration file to input the choices and settings that need to be made during setup. In Windows, this is referred to as an answer file.

*The Win Sys Image Manager is used to conf answer files. An answer file contains the info input during setup, such as product key, disk partitions, computer name, language and network settings*

Unattended installations are also often completed using **image deployment**. An image is a clone of an existing installation stored in one file. The image can contain the base OS and configuration settings, service packs and updates, applications software, and whatever else is required. An image can be stored on DVD or USB media or can be accessed over a network. Using image deployment means that machines use a consistent set of software and configuration options.


# Boot Method
----

The installation **boot method** refers to the way in which the setup program, answer file (if used), and OS files or system image are loaded onto the target PC. You may need to access the computer's firmware setup program to ensure that a particular boot method is available, enabled, and set to the highest priority.

### Optical Media

Historically, most attended installations and upgrades were run by booting from optical media (CD-ROM or DVD). The optical drive must be set as the priority boot device.

### USB and External Drives and Flash Drives

Fewer computers have optical drives these days. Another problem with disc-based installs is that the setup disc quickly becomes out-of-date and post-installation tasks for installing drivers, updates, and service packs can take longer than the original installation. One way around this is to build slipstreamed media, with all the various patches and drivers already applied. The media could be CD-ROM, DVD, or USB-attached flash drive or external drive connected by USB.

When using an external/hot-swappable hard drive or solid-state flash drive as boot media, the boot method should be set to use the USB-connected device as the priority option.

	`Microsoft provides a Media Creation Tool to create installation media from the product setup files. The tool can either make a bootable USB thumb drive or generate an ISO file that can be written to a physical DVD.`

### Network Boot

**Network boot** setup means connecting to a shared folder containing the installation files, which could be slipstreamed or use image deployment. The target PC must have a usable partition on the hard disk in which to store temporary files. There also needs to be some means of booting without having a suitably formatted local drive present. Most computers now come with a **Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE)****–**compliant firmware and network adapter to support this boot option. The client uses information provided via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to locate a suitably configured server that holds the installation files or images and starts the setup process.

### Internet-Based Boot

A computer that supports network boot could also be configured to boot to setup over the **Internet**. In this scenario, the local network’s DHCP server must be configured to supply the DNS name of the installation server.

More commonly, most setup installers need to connect to the Internet to download updates and optional packages.

	OS installs and deployments are also commonly performed on virtual machines operating in cloud environments. There are orchestration and automation tools designed to facilitate this process.

### Internal Hard Drive (Partition)

Once the OS has been installed, you will usually want to set the internal hard drive as the default (highest priority) boot device, and disable any other boot devices. This ensures the system doesn't try to boot to the setup media again. If access to the firmware setup program is secured, it also prevents someone from trying to install a new OS without authorization.

In other scenarios, an internal partition may also be used as a recovery partition. This boot method is discussed later in this topic.

# Disk Configuration
----

A mass storage device or fixed disk, such as hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), requires partitioning and formatting before it can be used. Partition and file system options can be chosen by responding to prompts in the setup program, configured in an answer file, or built into an image that is cloned to the target disk.

A partition is a logically separate storage area. You must create at least one partition on a fixed disk before performing a high-level format to create a file system.

Information about partitions is stored on the disk itself in one of two types: master boot record (MBR) or GUID [globally unique identifier] Partition Table (GPT).

### MBR-Style Partitioning

The **master boot record (MBR)** partition style stores a partition table in the first 512-byte sector on the disk. With MBR-style, a given physical disk can contain up to four primary partitions, any one of which can be marked as active, and therefore made bootable. This allows for four different drives on the same physical disk and for multiple operating systems (a multiboot system). You might also use partitions to create discrete areas for user data file storage, storing log files, or hosting databases. Each drive can be formatted with a different file system.

	If four drives are insufficient and GPT is not an option, one partition can be configured as extended and divided into as many logical drives as needed. Extended partitions do not have boot sectors and cannot be made active.

The start of each primary partition contains a boot sector, or partition boot record (PBR). When a partition is marked as active, its boot sector is populated with a record that points to the OS boot loader. In Windows, this active partition is also referred to as the system partition or system reserved. The drive containing the Windows operating system files is referred to as the boot partition. This can be on a logical drive in an extended partition and does not have to be the same as the system drive.

When the disk uses MBR partitioning, the system firmware must be set to use the legacy BIOS boot method. If the boot method is set to UEFI, the disk will not be recognized as a boot device.

### GPT-Style Partitioning

The **globally unique identifier** **(GUID) partition table (GPT)** style provides a more up-to-date scheme to address some of the limitations of MBR. One of the features of GPT is support for more than four primary partitions. Windows allows up to 128 partitions with GPT. GPT also supports larger partitions (2 TB+) and a backup copy of the partition entries. A GPT-style disk includes a protective MBR for compatibility with systems that do not recognize GPT.

When the disk uses GPT partitioning, the system firmware must be set to use the UEFI boot method. If the boot method is set to BIOS, the disk will not be recognized as a boot device.

  

### Drive Format

An OS must be installed to a partition formatted using a compatible file system. For Windows, this means using NTFS. macOS uses APFS and Linux can use ext3/ext4 or a variety of other file system types. During an attended installation, partition and formatting choices are guided by the setup program.

# Repair Installation
----

If a computer will not boot or if you are troubleshooting a problem such as slow performance and cannot find a single cause, it may be necessary to perform some sort of repair installation.

### Recovery Partition

A factory **recovery partition** is a tool used by OEMs to restore the OS environment to its ship state. The recovery partition is created on the **internal fixed drive**. If the main installation fails to boot, the system firmware can be used to select the recovery partition to boot the system, then a simple wizard-driven process replaces the damaged installation. The recovery process can be started by pressing a key during startup (**F11** or **CTRL+F11** are often used; a message is usually shown on-screen).

OEM media will not usually recover user data or settings or reinstall third-party applications—everything gets set back to the state in which the PC was shipped from the factory. User data should be recovered from backup, which must be made before the computer becomes unbootable.

The main disadvantages with OEM recovery media are that the tool only works if the original hard disk is still installed in the machine and will not include patches or service packs applied between the ship date and recovery date. The recovery image also takes up quite a lot of space and users may not feel that they are getting the disk capacity that they have paid for!

### Reset Windows

Windows supports refresh and reset options to try to repair the installation. Using refresh recopies the system files and reverts most system settings to the default but can preserve user personalization settings, data files, and apps installed via Windows Store. Desktop applications are removed.

Using the full reset option deletes the existing OS plus apps, settings, and data ready for the OS to be reinstalled.

# Review OS installations and Upgrade 
----
1. You are supporting a home user with upgrading a computer from Windows 10 to Windows 11. You have run Microsoft’s PC Health Check tool, and it verifies that the computer meets the hardware requirements. Should you now proceed with the in-place upgrade?

No. You must backup user data and settings first. A backup is essential as a security precaution.

2. You are writing some work instructions to assist technicians with deploying new user desktops via cloning. What type of installation and boot method is this process most likely to use, and what are the boot requirements?

Cloning refers to the image deployment installation method. An image is a copy of an existing installation saved as a single file. Image deployment could use USB boot media (or even optical discs), but network boot is more likely. Network boot requires a PXE-compatible network adapter and motherboard in the computer and the boot device priority set to network/PXE. The network requires a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server plus a remote network installation server to run unattended setup and apply the image.

3. You are repurposing an old computer. You perform a clean OS install using optical media. During setup, you configured the partition manager to apply GPT style. After the file copy stage, the new installation fails to boot. What is the likely cause?

The PC is set to boot using the legacy BIOS method. This is not compatible with GPT-style partitioning. If supported by system firmware setup, switch to UEFI boot. If the firmware is BIOS only, change the boot method back to optical disc, run setup again, and choose MBR partitioning.
