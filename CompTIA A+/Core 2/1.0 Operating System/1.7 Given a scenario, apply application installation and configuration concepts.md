An operating system on its own does not allow users to do useful work. Computers are productive devices because they run different kinds of software applications. Installing and configuring third-party applications is a crucial part of the IT support role. In this topic, you will learn the tools and features used to follow best practices for software management.

# System Requirements for Applications
----

**System requirements** for applications refers to the PC specification required to run third-party software. The app vendor should publish the requirements as support information.

### Central Processing Unit, System Memory, and Storage Requirements

**Central Processing Unit (CPU) requirements** refers to the performance and features of the computer’s main processor. Like operating systems, software applications can be developed as **32-bit or 64-bit** software. Some apps may have both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. A 64-bit application requires a 64-bit CPU and OS platform. It cannot be installed on a 32-bit platform. 32-bit software applications can usually be installed on 64-bit platforms, however.

Some applications will define minimum requirements for the CPU generation, clock speed, or number of cores. An application may also require a particular CPU feature, such as hardware-assisted virtualization or a trusted platform module (TPM).

	If a required feature is not detected, check the system setup program to make sure it hasn’t just been disabled.

There may also be a specific **RAM requirement**. This will generally assume that no other foreground software will run at the same time. Running multiple programs simultaneously will require more RAM.

**Storage requirements** refers to the amount of installation space the software will take up on the fixed disk. Of course, you must also provision space for additional file creation, such as user-generated data, temporary files, and log files.

### Dedicated Graphics Card Requirements

A PC’s graphics subsystem can be implemented as a feature of either the CPU or the motherboard chipset. This is referred to as **integrated graphics**. A demanding application, such as graphics design software or a game, is likely to require a **dedicated graphics card** with its own **video RAM**, separate from the general system RAM.

### External Hardware Token Requirements

An app might have a requirement or recommendation for using a more secure authentication method than a simple password. An **external hardware token** is a smart card or USB form factor device that stores some cryptographic user identification data. The user must present the token and supply a password, PIN, or fingerprint scan to authenticate.

# OS Requirements for Applications
----

Software apps also have **OS requirements**. One of these is **application to OS compatibility**. Every software application is designed to run under a specific operating system. When purchasing, you need to make sure you select the version for your OS. If you buy the macOS version, it will not run on Windows. Additionally, a software application might not be supported for use under newer operating systems. For example, if you have been using version 1 of the Widget App on Windows 7 and you subsequently upgrade to Windows 10, the Widget App might need to be upgraded to version 2 for full compatibility.

In Linux there are different package formats, but compatibility between distros is not generally an issue. Even if an app has not been released in a compatible package for a specific distro, it can still be compiled from its source code manually.

As noted above, if the application software is **64-bit**, then the CPU and the OS must also both be 64-bit. If the application is **32-bit**, it can be installed under either a 32-bit or 64-bit platform. For example, many of the software applications available for Windows are still 32-bit. In 64-bit Windows, they run within a special application environment called WOW64 (Windows on Windows 64-bit). This environment replicates the 32-bit environment expected by the application and translates its requests into ones that can be processed by the 64-bit CPU, memory, and file subsystems.

In a 64-bit Windows environment, 32-bit application files are installed to the `Program Files (x86)` folder, while 64-bit applications are stored in` Program Files `(unless the user chooses custom installation options). Windows' 64-bit shared system files (DLLs and EXEs) are stored in `%SystemRoot%\system32`; that is, the same system folder as 32-bit versions of Windows. Files for the 32-bit versions are stored in` %SystemRoot%\syswow64`.

# Distribution Methods
----

An app **distribution method** is the means by which the vendor makes it available to install. Many apps are published through app stores, in which case the installation mechanics are handled automatically.

Desktop applications are installed from a setup file. In Windows, these use either .EXE or .MSI extensions. Apps for macOS can use DMG or PKG formats. Linux packages use DEB packages with the APT package manager or RPM for YUM.

The setup file packs the application's executable(s), configuration files, and media files within it. During setup, the files are extracted and copied to a directory reserved for use for application installation.

This type of setup file can be distributed on **physical media**, such as CD/DVD or a USB thumb drive, or it could be **downloaded** from the Internet. When downloading an installer from an Internet location, it is imperative to verify the authenticity and integrity of the package and to scan it for malware. Windows uses a system of digital signatures to identify valid developers and software sources. Linux software is verified by publishing a hash value of the package. After download, you should generate your own hash of the package and compare it to the value published by the package maintainer.

As an alternative to physical media, an ISO file contains the contents of an optical disc in a single file. ISO files stored on removable media or a host system are often used to install virtual machine operating systems. A mountable ISO is often used to install complex apps, such as databases, where there are many separate components and large file sizes to install. In Windows, right-click an ISO file and select Mount. The ISO file will appear in File Explorer with the next available drive letter.

# Other Considerations
----

To maintain a secure and robust computing environment, potential impacts from deploying new applications must be assessed and mitigated. It is important that the IT department maintains control and oversight of all third-party software installed to network hosts. Unsanctioned software and devices—shadow IT—raises substantial operational and business risks.

### Impact to Business

In a corporate environment, any application that is installed must also be supported.

- **Licensing**—Commercial software must be used within the constraints of its license. This is likely to restrict either the number of devices on which the software can be installed or the number of users that can access it. Installing unlicensed software exposes a company to financial and legal penalties.
- **Support**—Software might be available with paid-for support to obtain updates, monitor and fix security issues, and provide technical assistance. Alternatively, security monitoring and user assistance could be performed by internal staff, but the impact to IT operations still needs assessing.
- **Training**—Complex apps can have a substantial and expensive user-training requirement. This can be an ongoing cost as new versions can introduce interface or feature changes that require more training or new employees require initial training. If the app is supported internally, there might also be a technical training requirement to ensure that staff can provide support and maintain the application in a secure state.

### Impact to Operation

As well as the broader business impacts, a project to deploy a new application must also consider impacts to operation. Where there are hundreds of desktops, the IT department will need to use automated tools to deploy, update, and support the app.

When an organization wants to deploy an application to a number of desktops, it is likely to use a network-based installer. In this scenario, the setup file is simply copied to a shared folder on the network, and client computers run the setup file from the network folder. In Windows, you can use policies—Group Policy Objects (GPOs)—to set a computer to remotely install an application from a network folder without any manual intervention from an administrator. Products such as centrally managed antivirus suites often support "push" deployment tools to remotely install the client or security sensor on each desktop.

One advantage of using a tool such as GPO to deploy applications is that a user does not have to log on to the local client with administrator privileges. Writing/modifying permissions over folders to which the application-executable files are installed are restricted to administrator-level accounts. This prevents unauthorized modification of the computer or the installation of programs that could threaten security policies. The setup file for a deployed application can run using a service account.

To run an application, the user needs to be granted read/execute permission over the application's installation directory. Any files created using the application or custom settings/preferences specific to a particular user should be saved to the user's home folder/profile rather than the application directory.

### Impact to Device and to Network

When selecting applications for installation on desktops, proper security considerations need to be made regarding potential **impacts to the device** (computer) and **to the network**. The principal threat is that of a Trojan Horse; that is, software whose true (malicious) purpose is concealed. Such malware is likely to be configured to try to steal data or provide covert remote access to the host or network once installed. A setup file could also be wittingly or unwittingly infected with a computer virus. These security issues can be mitigated by ensuring that software is only installed from trusted sources and that the installer code is digitally signed by a reputable software publisher.

As well as overt malware threats, software could impact the stability and performance of a computer or network. The software might consume more CPU and memory resources than anticipated or use an excessive amount of network bandwidth. There could be compatibility problems with other local or network applications. The software could contain unpatched vulnerabilities that could allow worm malware to propagate and crash the network. Ideally, applications should be tested in a lab environment before being deployed more widely. Research any security advisories associated with the software, and ensure that the developer has a robust approach to identifying and resolving security issues.


# Review Applications
----

1. You are writing work instructions for third-party app deployments using the CompTIA A+ objectives to guide you. In the section on system requirements for applications, you have covered the following topics:

- 32-bit- vs. 64-bit-dependent application requirements
- Dedicated graphics card vs. integrated (VRAM requirements)
- RAM requirements
- CPU requirements
- External hardware tokens

What additional topic should you include, if any?

Storage requirements. Each app takes up a certain amount of space when installed to the fixed disk. Also, you must plan for user-generated file storage, temp files, log files, and other data generated through use of the app.

2. You have downloaded an installer for a third-party app from the vendor’s website. What should you do before proceeding with setup?

Verify the integrity of the download using a hash value or the vendor’s digital certificate.

3. You are writing guidance for departmental managers to request new software installs. You want each manager to consider impacts to the business, operation, network, and devices as part of their request. In terms of impacts to business, you have written guidance to consider support and training requirements. What other topic should you include?

To consider licensing requirements, such as number of users or devices. There also needs to be a system for monitoring license compliance and ensuring there are no unauthorized installs.
