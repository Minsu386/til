Mac computers from Apple use the macOS operating system. Mac users tend to be found in art, music, graphic design, and education because macOS includes apps geared to those audiences. In this topic, you will examine some of the important features and functions of macOS.

# Interface Features
---

If you are using an Apple Mac computer for the first time, you will notice that the desktop and user interface is like a Windows-based PC in some respects but different in others. As with Windows, a Mac boots to a graphical desktop environment. Any apps that have been installed and configured to launch at boot will also start.

At the top of the screen is the menu bar. This is always present with all apps, but the menu titles change to show commands for the active window.

To the left of the menu bar is the Apple menu. This can be used to report support information (About) and log out or shut down the computer.

### Dock

The **dock** at the bottom of the screen gives one-click access to your favorite apps and files, similar to the taskbar in Windows. Apps that are open in the dock display a dot below the icon.

### Spotlight Search

**Spotlight Search** can be used to find almost anything on macOS. To start a new search, click the magnifying glass in the menu bar or press **COMMAND+SPACE** to bring up the search box. 

### Terminal

The **Terminal** can be used to access the command-line environment, which uses either the Z shell (zsh) or Bash. Older macOS versions use Bash, while zsh is the default from Catalina up.

### Mission Control and Multiple Desktops

The **Mission Control** feature is used for window management and enables the user to set up **multiple desktops** with different sets of apps, backgrounds, and so on.

To set up and remove desktops, activate **Mission Control** with the **F3** key. Once you have activated a new desktop, if you want an app to only run on Desktop 2, click its window and drag it onto the Desktop 2 screen at the top. To switch between desktops, press the **F3** key and choose a desktop or use **CONTROL+LEFT** or **CONTROL+RIGHT** or a 3-/4-finger swipe gesture.

# System Preferences
----

The **System Preferences** panel is the equivalent of the Windows Settings app. It is the central "go-to" place for changing settings and network options and optimizing a macOS configuration.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020174810.png)

Among other things, System Preferences can be used to configure input device options. You should be aware of some differences between the input devices used for Macs and those used for PCs.

### Apple Keyboards

Where PC and Linux keyboards use **CTRL**, **ALT**, **ALTGR**, and **START** modifier keys, Mac keyboards have an **APPLE/POWER** key and **COMMAND**, **OPTION**, and **CONTROL** keys. **COMMAND** is closest to the **CTRL** key in terms of functionality, and **OPTION** is usually mapped to **ALT**.

Use the **Keyboard** pane in System Preferences to map keys if using a non-Apple keyboard to operate a Mac.

### Apple Magic Mouse and Trackpad and Gesture Support

Macs do not support touch screen interfaces, but they do support **gesture**-enabled Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad peripherals. To see what gestures are available on the Mac or to change any of the settings, open the **Trackpad** prefpane.

### Displays

The **Displays** prefpane allows you to scale the desktop, set the brightness level, calibrate to a given color profile, and configure Night Shift settings to make the display adapt to ambient light conditions.

### Accessibility

The **Accessibility** prefpane is used to configure assistive vision and sound options, such as VoiceOver narration of screen elements, cursor size and motion settings, zoom tools, display contrast and font sizes, and captioning.

# Security and User Management
----

An Administrator account and an optional Guest User account are created when macOS is installed. To add a new account, open **System Preferences > Users & Groups**. 

### Apple ID

Each local account can be associated with an **Apple ID**. This Apple ID is used for purchases from the App Store, accessing iCloud and other functions. A user may already have an Apple ID from previous iTunes purchases or an iOS device.

You can sign in and out of your Apple ID using the button on the System Preferences home page.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020174927.png)

### Security & Privacy

As with Windows, macOS has options to configure what analytics/telemetry data and personalized information can be collected, plus permissions for apps to use features such as the location service or camera or data stores such as contacts and calendar. You can adjust these options via the **Security & Privacy** prefpane.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020175003.png)

	In some prefpanes, changing settings requires administrator approval. Select the lock icon and authenticate to make those options available.

### Internet Accounts and Keychain

The **Internet Accounts** prefpane can be used to associate other email and cloud accounts with your login. The keychain helps you to manage passwords for these accounts, other websites, and Wi-Fi networks. This feature is also available as iCloud Keychain, which makes the same passwords securely available across all macOS and iOS devices. The keychain makes password management much easier, but occasionally problems can happen. If there are any problems, they will be identified by the **Keychain Access** app (in **Utilities**).

If you have forgotten a password, search for the website by typing into the search box. From the results, select the password that you want to view or change. Check the box for **Show password** and enter an administrator password to reveal the password for that device or service.

If warning messages are displayed, it's possible to attempt a repair with **Keychain First Aid**. 

### FileVault

**FileVault** is a disk encryption product. Encryption protects the data stored on a disk against the possibility that a threat actor could remove it from the computer and use a foreign OS to read the files.

When disk encryption is enabled, each user account must be configured with a password. When the disk is encrypted for the first time, you should configure a recovery method. This is an alternative method of unlocking the disk if a password is forgotten. The recovery key can be stored in an iCloud account or recorded locally (do not save the recovery key to the same disk as the encrypted data!).

# Finder and iCloud
----

As with Windows, a Mac can store files on local drives, but cloud storage can represent a more secure option and make it easier to synchronize data between devices.

### Finder

The **Finder** is the macOS equivalent of File Explorer in Windows. It lets the user navigate all the files and folders on a Mac. It is always present and open in the dock.

### iCloud

**iCloud** is Apple's online storage solution for its users. It provides a central, shared location for mail, contacts, calendar, photos, notes, reminders, and so on across macOS and iOS devices. By default, each user is provided with 5 GB of storage (at the time of writing), although it is possible to upgrade to more space for an additional monthly fee. This space is shared across all iCloud components and devices.

# App Installation and Management
----

There are two main distribution mechanisms for macOS apps: the App Store and app downloads.

### Installation from the App Store

The **App Store** provides a central portal for Apple and developers to distribute free and paid-for software. It is also used to distribute updates to macOS and new releases of the operating system. Access to the App Store is mediated by an Apple ID.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020175435.png)

### Installation of Download Apps

Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Skype are just three examples of apps that are not available in the App Store. To install any of these apps, it is necessary to download them from the vendor site, ensuring that you select the macOS version.

By default, macOS will only allow apps to be installed that have been downloaded from the Mac App Store. To allow the installation of download apps, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**. Select the padlock to make changes to the settings—you will need to enter the Administrator password to continue.

There are two main macOS package installer formats:

- **DMG** (disk image) format is used for simple installs where the package contents just need to be copied to the Applications folder.
- **PKG** format is used where app setup needs to perform additional actions, such as running a service or writing files to multiple folders.

When the app has been installed, it is placed in a directory with a **.APP** extension in the Applications folder.

	App installs might be restricted to the app store as a security setting.

# OS and App Updates
----

In macOS, the App Store checks daily for new **updates/patches** and releases of installed apps. If a new version is available, a notification will be shown against the App Store icon in the dock.

You will have a choice to either update the apps individually or update them all from the button at the top. It is recommended to choose **Update All** so that the latest versions of your apps and updates to macOS (not necessarily new versions) are on the Mac. It is also possible to automatically update apps to the latest version. To do this, go to **App Store > Preferences** and configure the appropriate settings:

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020175615.png)

Most apps that are downloaded and installed from a third-party developer will automatically check if updates are available each time they are run. A prompt will be displayed to update or to cancel. It's also possible to manually check for updates using the **Check for Updates** menu option in the app itself.


# Network and Device Settings
----

There are various options in System Preferences to add and configure hardware devices.

### Network

You can manage network settings either from the **Status** menu on the right-hand side of the menu bar or via System Preferences.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020175947.png)

Use the **Advanced** button to configure IP properties and proxy settings.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020175958.png)
*Select the Advanced Button in the Network prefpane to conf Wi-Fi options, IP and DNS settings, and proxy settings*

### Printers & Scanners

Use the **Printers & Scanners** prefpane to add and manage print and scan devices.

### Disk Utility

The **Disk Utility** app can be used to verify or repair a disk or file system. It can also be used to erase a disk with security options in case you are selling or passing on a Mac.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020180144.png)

There is no need to regularly defragment a Mac hard drive. It's possible to run a defragmentation, but it should only be needed very rarely.

### Optical Drives and Remote Disc

Since 2016, no Apple Mac has been sold with an internal optical drive. While an external USB drive can be used, another option is the **Remote Disc** app, which lets the user access a CD/DVD drive on another Mac or Windows computer. This isn't suitable for audio CDs, DVD movies, recordable CDs/DVDs, or Windows installation disks, however.

To set up Remote Disc sharing on a Mac, open **System Preferences > Sharing**, and then make sure the check box is ticked next to **DVD or CD sharing**. To access the optical drive, select **Remote Disc** in **Finder**.

# Time Machine Backup
----

The **Time Machine** prefpane enables data to be **backed up** to an external drive or partition formatted using either APFS or macOS’s older extended file system. By default, Time Machine keeps hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for a month, and weekly backups for all previous months. When the drive used to store backups becomes full, Time Machine removes older backups to free up space.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020180259.png)

To restore files from Time Machine, a timeline on the right-hand side of the screen will show the available backups. Using the **Finder** window in **Time Machine**, find the folder with the file (or files) that you want to restore. Then slide the timeline back to the date/time of the previous version.

	Time Machine stores backups on the local drive as snapshots as well as any available backup drive. If the backup drive is not attached, you may still be able to restore a file or version from the local snapshot. If the tick mark next to an item in the timeline is dimmed, the backup drive needs to be attached to restore that item.


# Troubleshoot Crashes and Boot Issues
----

macOS comes with several tools to troubleshoot app, OS, and data issues.

### App Crashes and Force Quit

When an app is busy or processing a complex request, the spinning wait cursor will appear and usually disappear again within a few seconds. Should it remain visible for longer, it is possible that the app has gone into an endless loop or entered a state where it is not possible to complete its process.

If a macOS app stops responding, it should be possible to close it down and restart without having to restart the computer. Run **Force Quit** from the **Apple** menu or press **COMMAND+OPTION+ESC**.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020180459.png)

### Recovery Menu

macOS includes a set of utilities that you can use to restore a Mac from the Time Machine backup program, reinstall macOS from a system image, or reformat or repair the system disk.

To access the **Recovery** menu, as you power up the Apple Mac, hold down the **COMMAND+R** keys until you see the Apple logo. After selecting your language, it will boot into macOS Recovery, enabling you to select from the options shown in the following figure.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231020180512.png)

When you reboot an Apple Mac, if the startup drive is not available for any reason and it's connected to the Internet, the computer will try to boot from a web-based drive.

Use a Time Machine snapshot backup if you want to restore the Mac to a specific point in time; for example, if you have replaced or reformatted the hard drive.
