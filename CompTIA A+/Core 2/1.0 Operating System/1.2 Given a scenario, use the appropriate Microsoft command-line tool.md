As an administrator, you will manage the computer through a GUI for some tasks and through a command-line interface for others. You should also know how to perform file management at the command prompt as well as the GUI.

# Command Prompt
----

You can run any command from the **Run** dialog. However, to input a series of commands or to view output from commands, you need to use the command shell. The **cmd.exe** shell processes the legacy command set that has been part of Windows since its earliest versions.

*You can run the legacy commands at a modern Windows PowerShell prompt too. In Windows 11, the command interface is redesigned as the Windows Terminal.*

### Administrative Command Prompt

You may need to run the command prompt with elevated privileges to execute a command. If a command cannot be run with standard privileges, the error message "The requested operation requires elevation." is displayed.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231018123627.png)

*Trying to run a command that requires elevation. You must open a new command prompt window as administrator.*

You cannot continue within the same window. You need to open a new command prompt as administrator. Right-click the command prompt shortcut, select **Run as administrator**, and then confirm the user access control (UAC) prompt. Alternatively, type cmd in the Instant Search box, and then press **CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER**.

When run as administrator, the title bar shows "Administrator: Command Prompt", and the default folder is C:\Windows\System32 rather than C:\Users\_Username

*You can use this technique to open other utilities such as Explorer or Notepad with administrative privileges.*

### Command Syntax

To run a command, type it at the prompt (>) using the command name and any switches and arguments using the proper syntax. When you have typed the command, press **ENTER** to execute it.

The syntax of a command lists which arguments you must use (plus ones that are optional) and the effect of the different switches. Switches are usually preceded by the forward slash escape character

*If an argument includes a space, it may need to be entered within quotes.*

As you enter commands, the prompt fills up with text. If this is distracting, you can use the cls command to clear the screen.

Some commands, such as nslookup or telnet, can operate in interactive mode. This means that using the command starts that program, and from that point, the prompt will only accept input relevant to the program. To exit the program, you use the exit or quit command (or press **CTRL+C**). The exit command will close the cmd window if not used within an interactive command.

### Getting Help

The command prompt includes a rudimentary help system. If you type help at the command prompt and then press **ENTER**, a list of available commands is displayed. If you enter help _Command_, the help system lists the syntax and switches used for the command. You can also display help on a particular command by using the /? switch. For example, netstat /? displays help on the netstat command.

# Navigation Commands
----

The string before > in the command prompt shows the working directory path. Commands will operate on the contents of the working directory unless a different absolute or relative path is specified as an argument.

*While Windows uses the backslash to delimit directories, if you type a path using forward slashes in Explorer or at the command prompt, it will still be interpreted correctly. The Linux file system uses forward slashes.*

### Listing Files and Directories

Use the dir command to list the files and subdirectories from either the working drive and directory or from a specified path.

You can present files in a particular order using the /o:_x_ switch, where _x_ could be n to list by name, s to list by size, e to list by extension, or d to list by date. The date field can be set by the /t:_x_ switch, where _x_ is c for created on, a for last access, or w for last modified.

Another useful switch is /a:_x_, which displays files with the attribute indicated by _x_ (r for Read-only, h for hidden, s for system, and a for archive).

*A wildcard character allows you to use unspecified characters with the command. A question mark (?) means a single unspecified character. For example, the command dir ????????.log will display all .log files with eight characters in the file name.*

### Changing the Current Directory

The cd command is used to set the focus to a different working directory. You can change to any directory by entering the full path, such as: cd C:\Users\David

There are several shortcuts, however:

- If the current directory is _C:\Users\David_ and you want to change to _C:\Users\David\Documents_, enter: cd Documents
- If the current directory is _C:\Users\David\Documents_ and you want to move up to the parent directory, enter: cd ..
- If the current directory is _C:\Users\David_ and you want to change to the root directory of the drive, enter: cd \
- If the current directory is _C:\Users_ and you want to change to _C:\Windows_, enter: cd \Windows

### Changing the Current Drive

The drive with focus is treated separately from the directory. To change the working drive, just enter the drive letter followed by a colon and press **ENTER**. For example, D: changes to the _D_ drive. The prompt will change to _D:\>_ indicating that the default drive is now drive D.



# File Management Commands
----

The move command and copy command provide the ability to transfer files contained in a single directory. Both commands use a three-part syntax: command _Source_ _Destination_ where _Source_ is the drive name, path, and name of the files to be moved/copied and _Destination_ is the drive name and path of the new location.

### Copying Directory Structures

xcopy command is a utility that allows you to copy the contents of more than one directory at a time and retain the directory structure. The syntax for xcopy is as follows: xcopy _Source_ [_Destination_] [_Switches_]

You can use switches to include or exclude files and folders by their attributes. Check the command help for additional switches and syntax.

robocopy command (or "robust copy") is another file copy utility. Microsoft now recommends using robocopy rather than xcopy. robocopy is designed to work better with long file names and NTFS attributes. Check the command help for additional switches and syntax.

*Despite the name, you can also use robocopy to move files (/mov switch).*

### Creating a Directory

To create a directory, use the md command. For example, to create a directory called _Data_ in the current directory, type md Data. To create a directory called _Docs_ in a directory called _Data_ on the A drive, when the current path is _C:\_, type md A:\Data\Docs


*Folder and file names cannot contain the reserved characters: \ / : * ? " < > |*

### Removing a Directory

To delete an empty directory, enter rd _Directory_ or rmdir_Directory_. If the directory is not empty, you can remove files and subdirectories from it using the /s switch. You can also use the /q switch to suppress confirmation messages (quiet mode).

# Disk Management Commands
----
The Disk Management snap-in is easy to use, but there are some circumstances where you may need to manage volumes at a command prompt.

### The diskpart Command

diskpart is the command interface underlying the Disk Management tool.Â 

There are too many options in diskpart to cover here, but the basic process of inspecting disks and partitions is as follows:

1. Run the diskpart utility, and then enter select disk 0 at the prompt (or the number of the disk you want to check).
2. Enter detail disk to display configuration information for the disk. The utility should report that the partitions (or volumes) are healthy. If diskpart reports that the hard disk has no partitions, the partition table may have become corrupted.
3. Enter either select partition 0 or select volume 0 at the prompt (or the number of the partition or volume you want to check).
4. Enter either detail partition or detail volume to view information about the object. You can now use commands such as assign (change the drive letter), delete (destroy the volume), or extend.
5. Enter exit to quit diskpart.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231018124046.png)

*The Disk Management tool prevents you from completing certain destructive actions, such as deleting the system or boot volume. diskpart is not restricted in this way, so use it with care.*

### The format Command

The format command writes a new file system to a drive. This process deletes any data existing on the drive.

The basic command is format _X_: /fs:SYS, where _X_ is a drive letter and _SYS_ is the file system, such as NTFS, FAT32, or EXFAT. By default, the command performs a scan for bad sectors first. This scan can be suppressed by using the /q switch. Use the online help for information about other switches.

*Both standard and quick format operations remove references to existing files in the volume boot record, but the actual sectors are not "scrubbed" or zeroed. Existing files will be overwritten as new files are added to the volume, but in principle, data can be recovered from a formatted disk (using third-party tools). A secure format utility prevents this by overwriting each sector with a zero value, sometimes using multiple passes.*

### The chkdsk Command

chkdsk scans the file system and/or disk sectors for faults and can attempt to repair any problems detected. A version of Check Disk (autochk) will also run automatically if the system detects file system errors at boot.

There are three ways to run the tool:

- chkdsk _X_: (where _X_ is the drive letter but no switch is used) runs the tool in read-only mode. The scan will report whether errors need to be repaired.
- chkdsk _X_: /f attempts to fix file system errors.
- chkdsk _X_: /r fixes file system errors and attempts recovery of bad sectors. You are prompted to save any recoverable data, which is copied to the root directory as filennnn.chk files.

Check Disk cannot fix open files, so you may be prompted to schedule the scan for the next system restart.

*_chkdsk /f and chkdsk /r can take a long time to run. Canceling a scan is not recommended. Run a read-only scan first._*



# System Management Commands
----

The shutdown command can be used to safely halt the system or log out:

- **Shutdown** (shutdown /s)âClose all open programs and services before powering off the computer. The user should save changes in any open files first but will be prompted to save any open files during shutdown. The shutdown /t _nn_ command can be used to specify delay in seconds before shutdown starts; the default is 30 seconds. If a shutdown is in progress, shutdown /a aborts it (if used quickly enough).
- **Hibernate** (shutdown /h)âSave the current session to disk before powering off the computer.
- **Log off** (shutdown /l)âClose all open programs and services started under the user account, but leave the computer running.
- **Restart** (shutdown /r)âClose all open programs and services before rebooting without powering down. This is also called a soft reset.

### System File Checker

The Windows Resource Protection mechanism prevents damage to or malicious use of system files and registry keys and files. The **System File Checker** utility (sfc) provides a manual interface for verifying system files and restoring them from cache if they are found to be corrupt or damaged.

The program can be used from an administrative command prompt in the following modes:

- sfc /scannow runs a scan immediately.
- sfc /scanonce schedules a scan when the computer is next restarted.
- sfc /scanboot schedules a scan that runs each time the PC boots.

*System files (and shared program files) are maintained, and version-controlled in the WINSxS system folder. This means that the product media is not called upon, but the WINSxS folder can consume quite a lot of disk space.*

###  Reporting the Windows Version

The winver command reports version information. You will often need to use this for support. Note that Windows version information requires some unpacking:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 is a âbrandâ version. Its main purpose is to identify the OS as a client version because Windows Server versions use the same codebase.
- Version refers to a feature update via a year/month code representing the time of release, such as 1607 (July 2016) or 21H1 (first half of 2021).
- OS Build is a two-part numeric value with the first part representing the brand plus feature update and the second rev part representing quality update status (patches). You can use the rev number to look up changes and known issues associated with the update in the Microsoft Knowledge Base ([support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com/)).

*While winver has its place, the About settings page is more informative as it also lists the edition and license information.*

# Review
----
1. You are attempting to run a command but receive the message âThe requested operation requires elevation.â What must you do to run the command?

Open a new command prompt window with sufficient privileges. You can right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as administrator or press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to execute the icon or cmd.exe command.

2. Which Windows command is probably best suited for scripting file backup operations?

The robocopy command offers more options than those offered by the xcopy command, so it will usually be the better choice. The copy command is quite basic and probably not suitable.

3. Is the command format d: /fs:exfat /q valid? If so, what is its effect, and what precaution might you need to take before running it?

Yes, it is valid. It formats drive D with the exFAT file system by using a quick format (does not scan for bad sectors). This will delete the file table on the drive so existing data files can be overwrittenâthe formatted drive will appear to be empty in Explorer. If there are existing files that need to be preserved, they should be backed up before running the format command.

4. How do you perform a scan to identify file system errors in read-only mode?

At a command prompt, run chkdsk without any switches. Note that sfc is not the correct answer as this verifies the integrity of protected system files rather than checks the file system on a drive.

5. Why might you run the shutdown command with the /t switch?

To specify a delay between running the command and shutdown starting. You might do this to give users a chance to save work or to ensure that a computer is restarted overnight.


# Summary 
----

You should be able to use management consoles and command-line utilities to manage Windows users, devices, apps, and performance.

### Guidelines for Managing Windows

Document standard procedures and work instructions to make best use of Windows management consoles and command-line utilities for different tasks:

- Use Device Manager, Disk Management, Disk Defragmenter, Disk Cleanup, chkdsk, diskpart, and format to ensure hardware availability, reliability, and performance.
- Use Local Users and Groups and Certificate Manager to manage users, personal digital certificates, and trusted root certificates.
- Use Group Policy Editor and Registry Editor for fine-grained settings configuration.
- Use System Information, Event Viewer, and winver to audit software and hardware inventory and monitor logs.
- Use Task Manager, Resource Monitor, Performance Monitor, System Configuration, shutdown, and sfc to optimize process, service, and startup performance.
- Use cd, dir, md, rmdir, x:, copy, xcopy, and robocopy to manage the file system from the command prompt.
