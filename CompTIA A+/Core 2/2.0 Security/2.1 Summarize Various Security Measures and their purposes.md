# Windows Domains and Active Directory
----


A local account is only recognized by the local machine and cannot be used to access other computers. For example, if the user David needs access to multiple computers in a workgroup environment, a separate local account must be configured on each computer (PC1\David, PC2\David, and so on). These accounts can use the same names and passwords for convenience, but the user must still authenticate to the accounts separately. Password changes are not synchronized between the machines and must be updated manually.

This model does not scale well to large numbers of users. Consequently, most business and educational organizations use Windows domain networks and accounts. A domain account can be authorized to access any computer joined to the domain. It can be assigned permissions on any resources hosted in the domain. 

### Domain Controllers

To create a **domain**, you need at least one Windows Server computer configured as a domain controller (DC). A DC stores a database of network information called Active Directory (AD). This database stores user, group, and computer objects. The DC is responsible for providing an authentication service to users as they attempt to sign in. Management of DCs and rights to create accounts in the domain is reserved to Domain Admins. This network model is centralized, robust, scalable, and secure.

### Member Servers

A member server is any server-based system that has been joined to the domain but does not maintain a copy of the Active Directory database. A member server provides file and print and application server services, such as Exchange for email or SQL Server for database or line-of-business applications. AD uses the Kerberos protocol to provision single sign-on authentication and authorization for compatible applications and services.

### Security Groups

A domain supports the use of **security groups** to assign permissions more easily and robustly. User accounts are given membership of a security groups to assign them permissions on the network. These permissions apply to any computer joined to the domain. For example, members of the Domain Admins security group can sign in on any computer in the domain, including DCs. A member of the Domain Users security group can only sign in on certain workstations and has no rights to sign in on a DC.

	Remember that accounts and security groups in a domain are configured in the Active Directory database stored on a Domain Controller, not on each PC. The Active Directory Users and Computers management console is used to create and modify AD accounts.
### Organizational Units

An **organizational unit (OU)** is a way of dividing a domain up into different administrative realms. You might create OUs to delegate responsibility for administering company departments or locations. For example, a "Sales" department manager could be delegated control with rights to add and delete user accounts and assign them to a Sales security group, but no rights to change account policies, such as requiring complex passwords. Standard users in the Sales OU could be given permission to sign in on computers in the Sales OU, but not on computers in other OUs.


# Group Policy and Login Scripts
----

A domain **group policy** configures computer settings and user profile settings. Some settings are exposed through standard objects and folders, such as Security Settings. Other settings are exposed by installing an Administrative Template. Administrative Templates can be used to define settings in third-party software too. Group policy can also be used to deploy software automatically.

Unlike a local computer, domain group policy objects (GPOs) can be applied to multiple user accounts and computers. This is done by linking a GPO to a domain or OU object in AD. For example, you could attach Sales GPOs to the Sales OU and the policies configured in those GPOs would apply to every user and computer account placed in the Sales OU. A domain or OU can be linked to multiple GPOs. A system of inheritance determines the resultant set of policies (RSoPs) that apply to a particular computer or user account.

### Group Policy Updates

When **updating** local or group security policies, it is important to be familiar with the use of two command-line tools:

- gpupdate—Policies are applied at sign-in and refreshed periodically (normally every 90 minutes). The gpupdate command is used to apply a new or changed policy to a computer and account profile immediately. Using the /force switch causes all policies (new and old) to be reapplied. The gpupdate command can be used with /logoff or /boot to allow a sign-out or reboot if the policy setting requires it.
- gpresult—This command displays the RSoP for a computer and user account. When run without switches, the current computer and user account policies are shown. The /s, /u, and /p switches can be used to specify a host (by name or IP address), user account, and password.

### Login Scripts

A **login script** performs some type of configuration or process activity when the user signs in. A login script can be defined via the user profile or assigned to an account via group policy. A login script can be used to configure the environment for the user—setting environmental variables, mapping drives to specific server-based folders, and mapping to printers or other resources, for example. A login script can also be used to ensure that the client meets the security requirements for signing on to the network. For example, if the client has out-of-date software, login can be denied until the software is updated.

	Most of these tasks can be implemented via GPO. Some companies prefer to use login scripts, and some prefer GPO.
