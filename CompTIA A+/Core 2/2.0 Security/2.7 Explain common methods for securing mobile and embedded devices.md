It is critical that the organization’s mobile-device security practices be specified via policies, procedures, and training. It is easy for mobile devices to be forgotten or overlooked because they don’t reside, or “live,” in the workplace in the same way that desktop computers do. Procedural and technical controls to manage these mobile devices mitigate the risk that they may introduce vulnerabilities in the company's network security.

# Screen Locks
----

If threat actors can access smartphones or tablets, they can obtain a huge amount of information with which to launch further attacks. Apart from confidential data files that might be stored on the device, it is highly likely that the user has cached passwords for services such as email or remote access VPN and websites. In addition to this, access to contacts and message history (SMS, text messaging, email, and IM) greatly assists social engineering attacks. Consequently, it is imperative that mobiles be protected against loss, theft, and lunchtime attacks by a screen lock.

A **screen lock** activates if the device is unused or if the user presses the power button. The user must perform a gesture to unlock the device. A **swipe** gesture means that access to the device is unauthenticated. Simply swiping across the screen will unlock the device. While this might be suitable for a tablet deployed for shared or public use, access to a personal device must be protected by an authentication mechanism:

- **Personal identification number (PIN)** **or password**—Most devices require a PIN or password to be configured to enable screen lock authentication and generate an encryption key. The PIN can act as a primary or backup authentication method. If the device is configured to limit the number of attempts, a 4- or 6-digit PIN should offer adequate security for general users as long as the chosen PIN is not a simple sequence (1234 or 4321) or an easily guessable date. If there is a high risk of compromise, a strong password should be configured.

- **Fingerprint**—Many devices use a fingerprint sensor as a bio-gesture unlocking method. The user performs an enrollment fingerprint scan to create a template that is stored within a secure cache on the device. To authenticate, the user touches the reader, and the device compares the confirmation scan to the template.
- **Facial recognition**—This method creates a template computed from a 3-D image of the user's face. A facial bio gesture has the advantage of being able to use the camera rather than a special sensor. 

	`If a bio gesture is configured, the PIN or password acts as a backup mechanism or is required for high-privilege tasks, such as performing a factory reset or changing screen lock settings.`

- **Pattern**—This requires the user to swipe a “join-the-dots” pattern. The pattern method has numerous weaknesses. It is easy to observe and can be reconstructed from smudges. Research has also demonstrated that users tend to select predictable patterns, such as C, M, N, O, and S shapes.

A screen lock can be configured to restrict **failed login attempts**. This means that if an incorrect passcode or bio gesture is used, the device locks for a set period. This could be configured to escalate—so the first incorrect attempt locks the device for 30 seconds, while the third attempt locks it for 10 minutes, for instance. This deters attempts to guess the passcode or use a spoofed biometric.


# Mobile Security Software
----
Mobile devices can use the same classes of security software as PCs and laptops to protect against malware, phishing, and software exploits.

### Patching/OS Updates

Keeping a mobile OS and its apps up to date with **patches/OS updates** (and ideally new OS versions) is as critical as it is for a desktop computer. The install base of iOS is generally better at applying updates because of the consistent hardware and software platform. Updates for iOS are delivered via **Settings > General > Software Update**. App updates are indicated via notifications on the app icon and delivered via the **Updates** page in the app store.

Android patches are more reliant on the device vendor as they must develop the patch for their own "flavor" of Android. Support for new OS versions can also be mixed. Android uses the notification bar to deliver updates. You can also go to **Settings > System > Advanced > System updates**.

### Antivirus/Anti-malware Apps

Modern smartphones are vulnerable to software exploits and being targets of malware and viruses, especially if an untrusted app source has been configured. However, the emerging nature of mobile OS threats and vulnerabilities makes it difficult to create pattern databases of known threats or to use heuristics to identify malicious app behaviors.

**Antivirus/anti-malware** apps designed for mobile devices tend to work more like content filters to block access to known phishing sites and block adware/spyware activity by apps. Most security scanner apps will also detect configuration errors and monitor the permissions allocated to apps and how they are using (or abusing) them. These apps usually also offer a third-party data backup and device location service.

### Firewall Apps

There are also **firewall apps** for mobile devices. These can be used to monitor app activity and prevent connections to ports or IP addresses. One issue for firewalls is that they must be able to control other apps and therefore logically work at a higher permission level (root). Installing an app with root access is challenging, however. "No-root" firewalls work by creating a virtual private network (VPN) and then controlling app access to the VPN.

# Enterprise Mobility Management
----

Mobile devices have replaced computers for many email and daily management tasks and are integral to accessing many other business processes and cloud-based applications. A mobile device deployment model describes the way employees are provided with mobile devices and applications.

- **Bring your own device (BYOD**)—The mobile device is owned by the employee. The mobile will have to meet whatever profile is required by the company (in terms of OS version and functionality), and the employee will have to agree on the installation of corporate apps and to some level of oversight and auditing. This model is usually the most popular with employees but poses the most difficulties for security and network managers.
- **Corporate owned, business only (COBO)**—The device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.
- **Corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE)**—The device is chosen and supplied by the company and remains its property. The employee may use it to access personal email and social media accounts and for personal web browsing (subject to whatever acceptable use policies are in force).
- **Choose your own device (CYOD)**—Similar to COPE but the employee is given a choice of device from a list.

Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a class of enterprise software designed to apply security policies to the use of smartphones and tablets in business networks. This software can be used to manage corporate-owned devices as well as BYOD.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107150051.png)

When the device is enrolled with the management software, it can be configured with policies to allow or restrict use of apps, corporate data, and built-in functions such as a video camera or microphone. Policies can also be set to ensure the device patch status is up to date, that antivirus software is present and updated, and that a device firewall has been applied and configured correctly.

A company needs to create a **profile of security requirements** and policies to apply for different employees and different sites or areas within a site. For example, it might be more secure to disable the camera function of any smartphone while onsite, but users might complain that they cannot use their phones for video calls. A sophisticated security system might be able to apply a more selective policy and disable the camera only when the device is within an area deemed high risk from a data confidentiality point-of-view. Some policies can be implemented with a technical solution; others require "soft" measures, such as training and disciplinary action.

# Mobile Data Security
----

If a mobile device is lost or stolen, there are mechanisms to recover it and to prevent any misuse or loss of data stored on the device.

### Device Encryption

All but the earliest versions of mobile device operating systems for smartphones and tablets provide some type of default encryption. In iOS, there are various levels of encryption.

- All user data on the device is always encrypted, but the key is stored on the device. This is primarily used as a means of wiping the device. The OS just needs to delete the key to make the data inaccessible rather than wiping each storage location.
- Email data and any apps using the "Data Protection" option are subject to a second round of encryption using a key derived from and protected by the user's credential. This provides security for data if the device is stolen. Not all user data is encrypted using the "Data Protection" option; contacts, SMS messages, and pictures are not, for example.

In iOS, Data Protection encryption is enabled automatically when you configure a passcode lock on the device.

In Android, there are substantial differences in encryption options between versions ([source.android.com/security/encryption](https://source.android.com/security/encryption)). As of Android 10, there is no full disk encryption as it is considered too detrimental to performance. User data is encrypted at file-level by default when a secure screen lock is configured.

### Remote Backup Applications

Most mobile OS devices are configured with a user account linked to the vendor's cloud services (iCloud for iOS, Google Sync for stock Android, and OneDrive for Microsoft). The user can then choose to automatically perform **remote backup** of data, apps, and settings to the cloud. A user may choose to use a different backup provider (OneDrive on an Android phone, for instance) or a third-party provider, such as Dropbox.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107150142.png)
*Using Google’s default remote backup service. Note that SMS and call history data are not included.*

As well as cloud services, a device can be backed up to a PC. For example, iOS supports making backups to macOS or to Windows via the iTunes program. A third option is for MDM software to be configured to back up user devices or the container workspace automatically.

# Locator Apps and Remote Wipe
----

Most smartphones and many tablets are fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. GPS is a means of determining a receiver's position on Earth based on information received from satellites. As GPS requires line-of-sight, it does not work indoors. An Indoor Positioning System (IPS) works out a device's location by triangulating its proximity to other radio sources, such as Wi-Fi access points or Bluetooth beacons.

The Location Service uses GPS and/or IPS to calculate a device's position on a map. The Location Service can be used with a **locator application** to find the device if it is lost or stolen. Both Android and iOS have built-in find-my-phone features. Third-party antivirus and MDM software is also likely to support this type of functionality. Once set up, the location of the phone can be tracked from any web browser when it is powered on.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107150226.png)
*You can use the Find My Device app to locate an Android device and remotely lock or wipe it (or send the current holder a polite message to please return it ASAP).*

Other functions of a locator app are to remotely lock the device, display a “Please return” message on the screen, call the device regularly at full volume, disable features such as the wallet, prevent changes to the passcode, and prevent location/network services from being disabled.

If a device is lost with no chance of recovery, it may be necessary to perform some level of **remote wipe** to protect data and account credentials. A device wipe performs a factory default reset and clears all data, apps, and settings.

When a wipe is being performed due to risks to corporate data, a device wipe might not be appropriate. If the device is enrolled with MDM, an enterprise wipe can be performed against the corporate container only. This removes any corporate accounts and files but leaves personal apps, accounts, settings, and files untouched.


# Internet of Things Security
----

The term **Internet of Things (IoT)** is used to describe the global network of personal devices, home appliances, home control systems, vehicles, and other items that have been equipped with sensors, software, and network connectivity. These features allow these types of objects to communicate and pass data among themselves and other traditional systems such as computer servers.

### Home Automation Systems

Smart devices are used to implement home automation systems. An IoT smart device network will generally use the following types of components:

- **Hub/control system**—IoT devices usually require a communications hub to facilitate wireless networking. There must also be a control system, as most IoT devices are headless, meaning they have no user control interface. A headless hub could be implemented as a smart speaker operated by voice control or use smartphone/PC app for configuration.
- **Smart device types**—IoT endpoints implement the function, (for example, a smart lightbulb, refrigerator, thermostat/heating control, or doorbell/video entry phone) that you can operate remotely. These devices are capable of compute, storage, and network functions that are all potentially vulnerable to exploits. Most smart devices use a Linux or Android kernel. Because they're effectively running mini-computers, smart devices are vulnerable to some of the standard attacks associated with web applications and network functions. Integrated peripherals such as cameras or microphones could be compromised to facilitate surveillance.
- **Wireless mesh networking**—While the hub might be connected to the Wi-Fi network, communications between devices are likely to use some type of mesh networking, such as Z-Wave or Zigbee. These wireless standards use less power and make it easier for smart devices to forward data between nodes.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107150334.png)
*Philips Hue smart lighting management app. The management app connects to the hub (a Hue Bridge) via Wi-Fi. The hub communicates with each light device using the Zigbee wireless mesh networking protocol. Note that features such as out-of-home control or integration with other control systems could widen the potential attack surface if this type of device is deployed in an office.*


### Security Concerns

Consumer-grade smart devices and home automation products can be poorly documented, and patch management/security response processes of vendors can be inadequate. When they are designed for residential use, IoT devices can suffer from weak defaults. They may be configured to "work" with a minimum of configuration effort. There may be recommended steps to secure the device and procedures to apply security patches that the customer never takes. For example, devices may be left configured with the default administrator password.

In a corporate workspace, the main risk from smart device placement is that of shadow IT, where employees deploy a network-enabled device without going through a change and configuration management process. A vulnerability in the device would put it at risk of being exploited as an access point to the network. These devices also pose a risk for remote working, where the employee joins the corporate VPN using a home wireless network that is likely to contain numerous undocumented vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses.

These risks can be mitigated by regular audits and through employee security awareness training.

# Review
----
1. What two types of biometric authentication mechanism are supported on smartphones?

Fingerprint recognition and facial recognition.

2. True or false? Updates are not necessary for iOS devices because the OS is closed source.

False. Closed source just means that the vendor controls development of the OS. It is still subject to updates to fix problems and introduce new features.

3. A company wants to minimize the number of devices and mobile OS versions that it must support but allow use of a device by employees for personal email and social networking. What mobile deployment model is the best fit for these requirements?

Corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE) will allow standardization to a single device and OS. As the requirement does not specify a single device and OS, choose your own device (CYOD) would also fit.

4. The marketing department has refitted a kitchen area and provisioned several smart appliances for employee use. Should the IT department have been consulted first?

Yes. Uncontrolled deployment of network-enabled devices is referred as shadow IT. The devices could increase the network attack surface and expose it to vulnerabilities. The devices must be deployed in a secure configuration and monitored for security advisories and updates.
