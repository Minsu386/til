ogical access controls ensure that each user is identified and authenticated before being allowed to use a host or network services. Supporting an access control system means defining strong authentication methods and using security groups to assign permissions to users. On a network, you can use a directory to simplify management of these controls. This topic will help you to understand and apply these configurations so that you can help to support both workgroup and domain networks.

# Windows Defender Antivirus
----
Even with UAC and execution control, there are still plenty of ways for malware to install onto a PC. A program might use particularly effective social engineering techniques to persuade the user to bypass the normal checks. The malware might exploit a vulnerability to execute without explicit consent. Malware might also not need to install itself to achieve threat-actor objectives, such as exfiltrating data weakening the system configuration or snooping around the network.

Antivirus (A-V) is software that can detect malware and prevent it from executing. The primary means of detection is to use a database of known virus patterns called definitions, signatures, or patterns. Another technique is to use heuristic identification. "Heuristic" means that the software uses knowledge of the sort of things that viruses do to try to spot (and block) virus-like behavior. Most antivirus software is better described as anti-malware, as it can detect software threats that are not technically virus-like, including spyware, Trojans, rootkits, ransomware, and cryptominers.

The broad range of threats posed by different types of malware and vulnerability exploits means that an anti-malware software solution is a critical component of workstation security. **Windows Defender Antivirus** is a core component of all Windows editions. Windows Defender Antivirus is managed via the Windows Security Center.

### Windows Defender Antivirus Updated Definitions

It is particularly important that antivirus software be updated regularly. Two types of updates are generally necessary:

- **Definition/pattern updates** are information about new viruses or malware. These updates may be made available daily or even hourly.
- **Scan engine/component updates** fix problems or make improvements to the scan software itself.

For Windows Defender Antivirus, these definitions and patches are delivered via Windows Update. Third-party software might also integrate its updates with Windows Update, or it might use its own updater. 

### Activating and Deactivating Windows Defender Antivirus

The nature of malware means that there should be no simple means of deactivating an antivirus product, or the malware could easily circumvent it. Defender Antivirus can be disabled temporarily by toggling the **Real-time protection** button. It will re-activate itself after a short period.

If a third-party antivirus product is installed, it will replace Windows Defender Antivirus. It can also be permanently disabled via group policy.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144449.png)

It might be necessary to exclude folders from scanning. For example, scanning the disk images of virtual machines can cause performance problems. Also, some legitimate software or development code can trigger false-positive alerts. Folders containing this type of data can be excluded from scanning.

It is important to check the status of the antivirus product regularly to ensure that it is activated and up to date.

# Windows Defender Firewall
----

Where the antivirus product protects against threats in the file system, Windows Defender Firewall implements a personal/host firewall to filter inbound and outbound network traffic. The basic Settings app interface allows you to activate or deactivate the firewall for a given network profile and to add exceptions that allow a process to accept inbound connections.

The Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security console allows configuration of custom inbound and outbound filtering rules. For each profile type, the default inbound and outbound policy can be set to block or allow. Each rule can be configured as a block or allow action to override the default policy for trigger ports, applications, and/or addresses:

- **Port security** triggers are based on the Transmission Control Port (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number used by the application protocol. For example, blocking TCP/80 prevents clients from connecting to the default port for a web server.
- **Application security** triggers are based on the process that listens for connections.
- **Address** triggers are based on the IP or FQDN of the server or client hosts.

The Advanced Firewall can be configured through group policy on a domain. On a standalone PC or workgroup, open the wf.msc management console. On the status page, you can click **Windows Defender Firewall properties** to configure each profile. The firewall can be turned on or off, and you can switch the default policy for inbound and outbound traffic between **Block** and **Allow**.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144530.png)

`Block stops traffic unless a specific rule allows it. Conversely, Allow accepts all traffic unless a specific rule blocks it. You can also use Block all connections to stop inbound connections regardless of the rules set up.`

From the main Advanced Firewall console, you enable, disable, and configure rules by selecting in the **Inbound Rules** or **Outbound Rules** folder as appropriate.

# User and Group Accounts
----

A **user account** is the principal means of controlling access to computer and network resources and assigning rights or privileges. In Windows, a user can be set up with a local account or a Microsoft account:

- A **local account** is defined on that computer only. For example, PC1\David is the username for an account configured on a host named PC1. A local user account is stored in a database known as the Security Account Manager (SAM), which is part of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry. Each machine maintains its own SAM and set of SIDs for accounts. Consequently, a local account cannot be used to log on to a different computer or access a file over the network.
- A **Microsoft account** is managed via an online portal (account.microsoft.com) and identified by an email address. Configuring access to a device by a Microsoft account creates a profile associated with a local account. Profile settings can be synchronized between devices via the online portal.

The guided setup process requires a Microsoft account to be configured initially. However, the account type can be switched from Microsoft to local or local to Microsoft as preferred via the **Your info** page in the Settings app.

### Security Groups

A security **group** is a collection of user accounts. Security groups are used when assigning permissions and rights, as it is more efficient to assign permissions to a group than to assign them individually to each user. You can set up a number of custom groups with least privilege permissions for different roles and then make user accounts members of the appropriate group(s).

Built-in groups are given a standard set of rights that allow them to perform appropriate system tasks.

- A user account that is a member of the **Administrators** group can perform all management tasks and generally has very high access to all files and other objects in the system. The local or Microsoft user created during setup is automatically added to this group. Other accounts should not routinely be added to the Administrators group. It is more secure to restrict membership of the Administrators group as tightly as possible.

	`There is also a _user_ account named "Administrator," but it is disabled by default to improve security.`

- A **standard account** is a member of the Users group. This group is generally only able to configure settings for its profile. However, it can also shut down the computer, run desktop applications, install and run store apps, and use printers. Additional accounts should be set up as standard users unless there is a compelling reason to add another administrative account.
- The **Guest** group is only present for legacy reasons. It has the same default permissions and rights as the User group.

	`The Guest _user_ account is disabled by default. Microsoft ended support for using the Guest account to login to Windows in a feature update. The Guest account is only used to implement file sharing without passwords.`

- The **Power Users** group is present to support legacy applications. Historically, this group was intended to have intermediate permissions between administrators and users. However, this approach created vulnerabilities that allowed accounts to escalate to the administrators group. In Windows 10/11, this group has the same permissions as the standard Users group. 

### Local Users and Groups

The **Local Users and Groups** management console provides an interface for managing both user and group accounts. Use the shortcut menus and object Properties dialogs to create, disable, and delete accounts, change account properties, reset user passwords, create custom groups, and modify group membership.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144719.png)

### net user Commands

You can also manage accounts at the command line using **net user**. You need to execute these commands in an administrative command prompt.

- Add a new user account and force the user to choose a new password at first login:

`net user dmartin Pa$$w0rd /add /fullname:"David Martin" /logonpasswordchg:yes`

- Disable the dmartin account:

net user dmartin /active:no

- Show the properties of the dmartin account:

net user dmartin

- Add the dmartin account to the Administrators local group:

net localgroup Administrators dmartin /add

# Windows Login Options
----

Windows authentication involves a complex architecture of components ([docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication)), but the following three scenarios are typical:

- **Windows local sign-in**—The Local Security Authority (LSA) compares the submitted credential to the one stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database, which is part of the registry. This is also referred to as interactive logon.
- **Windows network sign-in**—The LSA can pass the credentials for authentication to a network service. The preferred system for network authentication is based on a system called Kerberos.
- **Remote sign-in**—If the user's device is not connected to the local network, authentication can take place over some type of virtual private network (VPN) or web portal.

### Username and Password

A **username and password** credential is configured by creating the user account and choosing a password. The user can change the password by pressing **CTRL+ALT+DELETE** or using account settings. An administrator can also reset the password using Local Users and Groups.

### Windows Hello

The Windows Hello subsystem allows the user to configure an alternative means of authenticating. Depending on hardware support, the following options are available:

- **Personal identification number (PIN)**—Unlike a normal Microsoft account password, a Windows Hello PIN is separately configured for each device. It uses the trusted platform module (TPM) feature of the CPU or chipset and encryption to ensure that the PIN does not have to be stored on the device itself. This is designed to prevent the sort of sniffing and interception attacks that ordinary passwords are subject to. Despite the name, a PIN can contain letters and symbols.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107142310.png)
*Configuring Windows Hello sign-in options. This PC has the PIN method set up, but it does not have a fingerprint reader or a camera with infrared (IR) to produce a facial template that will be resistant to spoofing.*

	`A PIN must be configured to set up Windows Hello. The PIN acts as backup mechanism in case other methods become unavailable. For example, a camera may fail to work and make facial recognition impossible, or a hardware token might be lost or temporarily unavailable.`

- **Fingerprint**—This type of bio gesture authentication uses a sensor to scan the unique features of the user’s fingerprint.
- **Facial recognition**—This bio gesture uses a webcam to scan the unique features of the user’s face. The camera records a 3-D image using its infrared (IR) sensor to mitigate attempts to use a photo to spoof the authentication mechanism.
- **Security key**—This uses a removable USB token or smart card. It can also use a trusted smartphone with an NFC sensor.

	`From these descriptions, it might seem like only one factor is used, but there are two. The second factor is an encryption key stored in the TPM.`


### Single Sign-On

**Single sign-on (SSO)** means that a user authenticates once to a device or network to gain access to multiple applications or services. The Kerberos authentication and authorization model for Active Directory domain networks implements SSO. A user who has authenticated with Windows is also authenticated with the Windows domain's SQL Server and Exchange Server services. Another example is signing in to Windows with a Microsoft account and also being signed in to cloud applications such as OneDrive and Office365.

The advantage of SSO is that each user does not have to manage multiple digital identities and passwords. The disadvantage is that compromising the account also compromises multiple services. The use of passwords in SSO systems has proven extremely vulnerable to attacks.

The Windows Hello for Business mechanism seeks to mitigate these risks by transitioning to passwordless SSO. In general terms, this works as follows:

1. The user device is registered on the network. This uses public/private encryption key pair. The private key is only stored within the TPM of the user device and never transmitted over the network or known by the user. The public key is registered on the server.
2. When the user authenticates to the device via Windows Hello, the device communicates a secret encrypted by its private key to the network authentication server.
3. The server uses the public key to decrypt the secret. This proves that the secret really did come from the device as it could only have been encrypted by the private key. Therefore, the network server can authenticate the user account and issue it with an authorization token to use network services and applications.


# User Account Controls
----

**User Account Control (UAC)** is a Windows security feature designed to protect the system against malicious scripts and attacks that could exploit the powerful privileges assigned to accounts that are members of the Administrators group. UAC is an example of a least privilege security control. It requires the user to explicitly consent to performing a privileged task. UAC also allows an administrator to perform some action that requires elevated privileges within a standard user’s session.

- Tasks that are protected by UAC are shown with a Security Shield icon:

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107143905.png)



It is also possible to explicitly run a process as administrator. Some default shortcuts are set up this way. For example, the **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** shortcut will run as administrator. To run any shortcut as administrator, use its right-click context menu (**More > Run as administrator**) or press **CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER** to open it.

When a user needs to exercise administrative rights, she or he must explicitly confirm use of those rights:

- If the logged in account has standard privileges, an administrator's credentials must be entered via the consent dialog.
- If the logged in account is already an administrator, the user must still click through the consent dialog.
- ![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107142041.png)
*UAC requiring confirmation of the use of administrator privileges. This account is an administrator, so only a confirmation is required—no credentials have to be supplied*

UAC protects the system from malware running with elevated administrator privileges. This is a good thing, but if you need to perform numerous system administration tasks at the same time, UAC can prove frustrating. You can configure UAC notifications to appear more or less frequently by using the configuration option in the User Accounts applet. Lowering the notification level will make the system more vulnerable to malware, however.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107142104.png)
*Note that the default "Administrator" user account is not subject to UAC and so should be left disabled if the computer is to be used securely.*



# NTFS vs Share Permissions
----

When sharing a folder, the basic **Give access to** interface conceals some of the complexity of the Windows **NTFS versus share** permissions system:

- Share-level permissions only apply when a folder is accessed over a network connection. They offer no protection against a user who is logged on locally to the computer hosting the shared resource.
- NTFS permissions are applied for both network and local access and can be applied to folders and to individual files. NTFS permissions can be assigned directly to user accounts, but it is better practice to assign permissions to security groups and make users members of appropriate groups.

NTFS permissions can be configured for a file or folder using the **Security** tab in its properties dialog.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107143811.png)

The Security tab shows the ACL applied to the file or folder. Each access control entry (ACE) assigns a set of permissions to a principal. A principal can either be a user account or a security group. The simple permissions are as follows:

- Read/list/execute permissions allows principals to open and browse files and folders and to run executable files.
- Write allows the principal to create files and subfolders and to append data to files.
- Modify allows the principal write permission plus the ability to change existing file data and delete files and folders.
- Full control allows all the other permissions plus the ability to change permissions and change the owner of the file or folder.

Each permission can be configured as either allow or deny. Each object has an implicit deny that prevents a principal from using a permission it has not been assigned. Explicit deny permissions are used to achieve more complex configurations.

A user may obtain multiple permissions from membership of different groups or by having permissions allocated directly to his or her account. Windows analyzes the permissions obtained from different accounts to determine the effective permissions. In this process, it is important to understand that an explicit deny overrides anything else (in most cases).

Putting explicit deny permissions to one side, the user obtains the most effective allow permissions obtained from any source. For example, if membership of a "Sales" group gives the user Read permission and membership of a "Managers" group gives the user Modify permission, the user's effective permission is Modify.

	`If a user attempts to view or save a file with insufficient permissions to do so, Windows displays an Access Denied error message. The Advanced interface includes a tool that can be used to evaluate effective permissions for a given principal.`


# Bitlocker and Bitlocker to Go
----
An alternative to file encryption is to use a full disk encryption (FDE) product. The Windows **BitLocker** disk encryption product is available with all editions of Windows except for the Home edition.

Full disk encryption carries a processing overhead, but modern computers usually have processing capacity to spare. The main advantage is that it does not depend on the user to remember to encrypt data. Disk encryption also encrypts the swap file, print queues, temporary files, and so on.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144120.png)

BitLocker can be used with any volumes on fixed (internal) drives. It can also be used with removable drives in its **BitLocker To Go** form.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144129.png)

When the data is encrypted, the user must have access to the encryption key to access it. BitLocker can make use of a trusted platform module (TPM) chip in the computer to tie use of a fixed disk to a particular motherboard. The TPM is used as a secure means of storing the encryption key and to ensure the integrity of the OS used to boot the machine. Alternatively, the key could be stored on a removable smart card or on a USB stick. The computer's firmware must support booting from USB for the last option to work.

	`The TPM must be configured with an owner password (often the system password set in firmware). You can manage TPM settings from Windows using the TPM Management snap-in (select TPM Administration from the BitLocker applet).`

During BitLocker setup, a recovery key is also generated. This should be stored on removable media (or written down) and stored securely (and separately from the computer). This key can be used to recover the encrypted drive if the startup key is lost.

# Encryption File System (EFS)
----

When data is hosted on a file system, it can be protected by the operating system's security model. Each file or folder can be configured with an access control list (ACL), describing the permissions that principals have on the file. These permissions are enforced only when the OS mediates access to the device. If the disk is exposed to a different OS, the permissions could be overridden. Data on persistent storage—HDDs, SSDs, and thumb drives—is referred to as **data-at-rest**. To protect data-at-rest against these risks, the information stored on a disk can be encrypted.

	`Data-at-rest contrasts with information sent over a network (data-in-transit) and information stored in nonpersistent CPU registers, cache, and system RAM (data-in-use).`

One approach to protecting file system data is to apply encryption to individual files or folders. The **Encrypting File System (EFS)** feature of NTFS supports file and folder encryption. EFS is not available in the Home edition of Windows.

To apply encryption, open the file's or folder's property sheet and select the **Advanced** button. Check the **Encrypt contents** box, then confirm the dialogs.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144217.png)

Folders and files that have been encrypted can be shown with green color coding in Explorer. Any user other than the one who encrypted the file will receive an "Access Denied" error when trying to browse, copy, or print the file.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231107144226.png)


Without strong authentication, encrypted data is only as secure as the user account password. If the password can be compromised, then so can the data. The user's password grants access to the key that performs the file encryption and decryption. There is also the chance of data loss if the key is lost or damaged. This can happen if the user's profile is damaged, if the user's password is reset by an administrator, or if Windows is reinstalled. It is possible to back up the key or (on a Windows domain) to set up recovery agents with the ability to decrypt data.
