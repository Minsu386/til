PC support tasks must be completed without causing physical injury to yourself or others and without damaging the equipment that you are servicing. There are several tools to use and operational procedures to follow to get the job done quickly, safely, and correctly.

There is also the issue of environmental impacts on computer systems to consider. Computers need stable power supplies and are sensitive to excessive heat. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you must understand the use of controls to ensure the proper environmental conditions for IT systems.

# Compliance with Regulations
----
When performing PC maintenance work, you may need to take account of compliance with government regulations. Regulations that typically affect PC maintenance or the installation of new equipment are:

- **Health and safety laws**—Keeping the workplace free from hazards.
- **Building codes**—Ensuring that fire prevention and electrical systems are intact and safe.
- **Environmental regulations**—Disposing of waste correctly.

For example, in the United States, the most common safety regulations are those issued by the federal government, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state standards regarding employee safety.

While specific regulations may vary from country to country and state to state, in general, employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthy working environment for their employees. Employees have a responsibility to use equipment in the workplace in accordance with the guidelines given to them and to report any hazards. Employees should also not interfere with any safety systems, including signs or warnings or devices such as firefighting equipment. Employees should not introduce or install devices, equipment, or materials to the workplace without authorization or without assessing the installation.

# Electrical Safety
----

Electricity flows in a circuit. A circuit is made when conductors form a continuous path between the positive and negative terminals of a power source. An electrical circuit has the following properties:

- Current is the amount of charge flowing through a conductor, measured in amps (A or I).
- Voltage is the potential difference between two points (often likened to pressure in a water pipe) measured in volts (V).
- Resistance is degree of opposition to the current caused by characteristics of the conductor, measured in ohms (Ω or R).

Electrical equipment can give a shock if it is broken, faulty, or installed incorrectly. An electric shock can cause muscle spasms, severe burns, or even death. 

### Fuses

An electrical device must be fitted with a fuse appropriate to its maximum current, such as 3A, 5A, or 13A. A fuse blows if there is a problem with the electrical supply, breaking the circuit to the power source. If the fuse fitted is rated too low, it will blow too easily; if the rating is too high, it may not blow when it should and will allow too much current to pass through the device.

	Take care with strip sockets. The total amperage of devices connected to the strip must not exceed the strip's maximum load (typically 13 amps).

### Equipment Grounding

Electrical equipment must be grounded. If there is a fault that causes metal parts in the equipment to become live, a ground provides a path of least resistance for the electrical current to flow away harmlessly. Devices such as PCs and printers are connected to the building ground via the power plug. However, the large metal equipment racks often used to house servers and network equipment must also be grounded. Do not disconnect the ground wire. If it must be removed, make sure it is replaced by a professional electrician.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231115132336.png)

	Electrical currents can pass through metal and most liquids, so neither should be allowed to come into contact with any electrical device installations. Damaged components or cables are also a risk and should be replaced or isolated immediately. It is important to test electrical devices regularly. The frequency will depend on the environment in which the device is used. In some countries, portable appliance testing (PAT) carried out by a qualified electrician or technician ensures that a device is safe to use.

### Proper Power Handling and Personal Safety

Whenever you add or replace components within a PC or laptop, the power must be disconnected first. Remove the AC plug and also remove the battery if present. Hold down the power button on the device to ensure the circuits are drained of residual power.

PC power supply units can carry dangerously high levels of voltage. Charges held in capacitors can persist for hours after the power supply is turned off. You should not open these units unless you have been specifically trained to do so. Adhere to all printed warnings, and never remove or break open any safety devices that carry such a warning.

	Never insert anything into the power supply fan to get it to rotate. This approach does not work, and it is dangerous.


# Other Safety Hazard Mitigations
----
In addition to electrical hazards, there are other safety hazards that computer technicians must account for. 

### Trip Hazards

A trip hazard is caused by putting any object in pathways where people walk.

- When installing equipment, ensure that cabling is secured, using cable ties or cable management products if necessary. Check that cables running under a desk cannot be kicked out by a user's feet. Do not run cabling across walkways, but if there is no option but to do so, use a cord protector to cover the cabling.
- When servicing equipment, do not leave devices (PC cases, for instance) in walkways or near the edge of a desk (where they could be knocked off). Be careful about putting down heavy or bulky equipment (ensure that it cannot topple).

### Lifting Techniques

Lifting a heavy object in the wrong way can damage your back or cause muscle strains and ligament damage. You may also drop the object and injure yourself or damage the object. When you need to lift or carry items, be aware of the maximum safe lifting weight as well as any restrictions and guidance set out in your job description or site safety handbook. To lift a heavy object safely:

1. Plant your feet around the object with one foot slightly toward the direction in which you are going to move.
2. Bend your knees to reach the object while keeping your back as straight and comfortable as possible and your chin up.
3. Find a firm grip on the object, and then lift smoothly by straightening your legs—do not jerk the object up.
4. Carry the object while keeping your back straight.
5. To lower an object, reverse the lifting process; keep your chin up and bend at the knees. Take care not to trap your fingers or to lower the object onto your feet.

If you cannot lift an object because it is too awkward or heavy, then get help from a coworker or use a cart to relocate the equipment. If you use a cart, make sure the equipment is tightly secured during transport. Do not stack loose items on a cart. If you need to carry an object for some distance, make sure that the route is unobstructed and that the pathway (including stairs or doorways) is wide and tall enough.

### Safety Goggles and Masks

If necessary, you should obtain protective clothing for handling equipment and materials that can be hazardous:

- Use gloves and safety goggles to minimize any risk of burns from corrosive materials such as broken batteries, cell phones, and tablets or irritation from particles such as toner or dust.
- When you are using a compressed air canister, working around toner spills, or working in a dusty environment, use an air-filter mask that fits over your mouth and nose. People who suffer from asthma or bronchitis should avoid changing toner cartridges where possible.

# Environmental Impacts
----

The location in which computer equipment is placed can affect its proper operation and lifespan. All electronic equipment should be kept away from extremes of temperature and damp or dusty conditions. 

### Dust Cleanup

Dust is drawn into the computer via ventilation holes. Over time, the dust can form a thick layer over components, heat sinks, fan blades, and ventilation slots, preventing effective heat dissipation. It can clog up peripherals such as keyboards and mice. Dust and smears can make the display hard to read. To perform dust cleanup:

- Use a compressed air blaster to dislodge dust from difficult-to-reach areas. Take care with use, however, as you risk contaminating the environment with dust. Ideally, perform this sort of maintenance within a controlled work area, and wear an appropriate air-filter mask and goggles.

	`Do not use compressed air blasters to clean up a toner spill or a laser printer within an office-type area. You will blow fine toner dust into the atmosphere and create a health hazard.`

- Use a PC vacuum cleaner or natural bristle brush to remove dust from inside the system unit, especially from the motherboard, adapter cards, and fan assemblies. Domestic vacuum appliances should not be used as they can produce high levels of static electricity. PC-safe vacuums can often be used to blow air as well as for suction, so they can replace the need for compressed air canisters.

	`A PC vacuum can be used to deal with toner spills only if the filter and bag are fine enough to contain toner particles. Such vacuums should be labelled as toner-safe. Ideally, move the printer to a maintenance room with filters to contain airborne particles. Alternatively, a toner cloth is a special cloth for wiping up loose toner. Be careful if you are using it inside the printer so that the cloth does not get caught on any components and leave fibers behind.`

### Temperature, Humidity, and Ventilation Control

A computer that is too hot is likely to be unreliable. A computer must be ventilated so that its fans can draw relatively cool air across the motherboard and expel the warmed air from the rear vents. You must ensure that the room (ambient) temperature is not too high and that there is space for air to flow around the case, especially around the ventilation slots. Do not place the computer in direct sunlight or near a radiator.

High humidity—the amount of water vapor in the air—can cause condensation to form. On the other hand, low humidity allows static charges to build up more easily and increases the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD). The ideal level is around 50%.

Condensation can form because of sudden warming. When installing new equipment that has just been delivered, it is important to leave it in its packaging for a few hours—depending on the outside temperature—to allow it to adjust to room temperature gradually.

# Electrostatic Discharge Mitigation
----

Static electricity is a high voltage, low current charge stored in an insulated body. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) occurs when a path allows electrons to rush from a statically charged body to a component that has no charge. This can occur through touch or even over a small gap if the charge is high enough. Static electricity discharged into the delicate structure of electronic devices will flash-over between the conductive tracks, damaging or even vaporizing them. A static discharge may make a chip completely unusable. If not, it is likely to fail at some later time. Damage occurring in this way can be hidden for many months and might only manifest itself in occasional failures.

The human body is mostly water and so does not generate or store static electricity very well. Unfortunately, our clothes are often made of synthetic materials, such as nylon and polyester, which act as good generators of static electricity and provide insulating layers that allow charges to accumulate, especially when walking over carpet. Humidity and climate also affect the likelihood of ESD. The risk increases during dry, cool conditions when humidity is low. In humid conditions, the residual charge can bleed into the environment before it can increase sufficiently to be harmful to electrical components.

### Proper Component Handling

Proper component handling tools and techniques protect electronic components against ESD when you service a PC or mobile device:

- If possible, work in an uncarpeted area. Ideally, use an ESD-safe floor or chair mat.
- Touch an unpainted part of a metal computer chassis or power supply case to drain residual charge from your body. This is only a temporary solution, and a static charge could build up again.

	`For your safety, unplug the computer from building power before opening the chassis.`

- Wear an anti-ESD wrist strap or leg strap to dissipate static charges more effectively. The band should fit snugly around your wrist or ankle so that the metal stud makes contact with your skin. Do not wear it over clothing. The strap ground is made either using a grounding plug that plugs into a wall socket or a crocodile clip that attaches to a grounded point or an unpainted part of the computer's metal chassis.
- ![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231115132622.png)

	`Ensure that the strap has a working current-limiting resistor for safety (straps should be tested daily). Do not use a grounding plug if there is any suspicion of a fault in the socket or in the building's electrical wiring or if the wiring is not regularly inspected and tested.`

- Use an anti-ESD service mat as a place to organize sensitive components. The mats contain a snap that you connect to the wrist or leg strap.
- Handle vulnerable components by holding the edges of the plastic mounting card. Avoid touching the surfaces of the chips themselves.
- ![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231115132640.png)
### Proper Component Storage

Electronic components, assemblies, and spare parts are shipped and stored in antistatic packaging to protect them from ESD damage:

- **Antistatic bags**—This packaging reduces the risk of ESD because it is coated with a conductive material. This material prevents static electricity from discharging through the inside of the bag. These bags are usually a shiny, gray metallic color. To protect the contents of the bag fully, you should seal it or at least fold the top over and seal that down.
- **Dissipative packaging**—This light pink or blue packaging reduces the buildup of static in the general vicinity of the contents by being slightly more conductive than normal. A plastic bag or foam packaging may be sprayed with an antistatic coating or have antistatic materials added to the plastic compound. This is used to package non-static-sensitive components packed in proximity to static-sensitive components.


# Building Power Issues and Mitigations
----
Faults in building power supply cause power problems such as surges, brownouts, and blackouts:

- **Surges**—A surge is a brief increase in voltage, while a spike is an intense surge. A surge or spike can be caused by machinery and other high-power devices being turned on or off and by lightning strikes. This type of event can take the supply voltage well over its normal value and cause sufficient interference to a computer to crash it, reboot it, or even damage it.
- **Under-voltage event**—Devices with large motors, such as lifts, washing machines, power tools, and transformers, require high-starting, or inrush, current. This might cause the building supply voltage to dip briefly, resulting in a under-voltage event. Overloaded or faulty building power-distribution circuits sometimes cause an under-voltage event. An under-voltage event could cause computer equipment to power off.
- **Power failure**—A power failure is complete loss of power. This will cause a computer to power off suddenly. A blackout may be caused by a disruption to the power distribution grid—an equipment failure or the accidental cutting of a cable during construction work, for example—or may simply happen because a fuse has blown or a circuit breaker has tripped.

A range of power protection devices is available to mitigate the faults these power events can cause in computer equipment.

### Surge Suppressors

Passive protection devices can be used to filter out the effects of surges and spikes. The simplest surge suppressor devices come in the form of adapters, trailing sockets, or filter plugs, with the protection circuitry built into the unit. These devices offer low-cost protection to one or two pieces of equipment. Surge protectors are rated according to various national and international standards, including Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 1449. There are three important characteristics:

- **Clamping voltage**—Defines the level at which the protection circuitry will activate, with lower voltages (400 V or 300 V) offering better protection.
- **Joules rating**—The amount of energy the surge protector can absorb, with 600 joules or more offering better protection. Each surge event will degrade the capability of the suppressor.
- **Amperage**—The maximum current that can be carried or basically the number of devices you can attach. As a rule of thumb, you should only use 80% of the rated capacity. For example, the devices connected to a 15 A protector should be drawing no more than 12 A. Of course, for domestic wiring, you should take care not to overload the building's power circuits in any case.

### Battery Backups

Sudden power loss is likely to cause file corruption. If there is loss of power due to a brownout or blackout, system operation can be sustained for a few minutes by using battery backup. Battery backup can be provisioned at the component level for disk drives, RAID arrays, and memory modules. The battery protects any read or write operations cached at the time of power loss.

At the system level, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) will provide a temporary power source in the event of complete power loss. The time allowed by a UPS is sufficient to activate an alternative power source, such as a standby generator. If there is no alternative power source, a UPS will at least allow you to save files and shut down the server or appliance properly.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231115132718.png)

The key characteristics of a UPS are volt-amperes (VA) rating and runtime:

- VA rating is the maximum load the UPS can sustain. To work out the minimum VA, sum the wattage of all the devices that will be attached to the UPS and multiply by 1.67 to account for a conversion factor. For example, if you have a 10 W home router and two 250 W computers, the VA is (10 + 250 + 250) * 1.67 = 852 VA. A 1K VA UPS model should therefore be sufficient.
- Runtime is the number of minutes that the batteries will supply power. The strength of the UPS batteries is measured in amp hours (Ah).

Vendors provide calculators to help select an appropriate UPS size for the required load and runtime.


# Materials handling and Responsible Disposal
----

Some of the components and consumables used with computer and printer systems can be hazardous to health and to the environment. You must comply with all relevant regulations when handling and disposing of these substances.

### Material Safety Data Sheets

Employers are obliged to assess the risk to their workforce from hazardous substances at work and to take steps to eliminate or control that risk. No work with hazardous substances should take place unless an assessment has been made. Employees are within their rights to refuse to work with hazardous substances that have not been assessed.

Suppliers of chemicals are required to identify the hazards associated with the substances they supply. Some hazard information will be provided on labels, but the supplier must also provide more detailed information on a material safety data sheet (MSDS). An MSDS will contain information about ingredients, health hazards, precautions, and first aid information and what to do if the material is spilled or leaks. The MSDS should also include information about how to recycle any waste product or dispose of it safely.

You may need to refer to an MSDS in the course of handling monitors, power supplies, batteries, laser-printer toner, and cleaning products. If handling devices that are broken or leaking, use appropriate protective gear, such as gloves, safety goggles, and an air-filter mask.

### Proper Disposal

Even with procedures in place to properly maintain IT equipment, eventually it will need to be decommissioned and either disposed of or recycled. IT equipment contains numerous components and materials that can cause environmental damage if they are disposed of as ordinary refuse. Waste disposal regulations to ensure protection of the environment are enforced by the federal and local governments in the United States and many other nations. Computer equipment is typically classed as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE).

Special care must be taken in respect of the following device types:

- **Battery disposal**—Swollen or leaking batteries from laptop computers or within cell phones and tablets must be handled very carefully and stored within appropriate containers. Use gloves and safety goggles to minimize any risk of burns from corrosive material. Batteries must be disposed of through an approved waste management and recycling facility.
- **Toner disposal**—Photocopier and laser-printer toner is an extremely fine powder. The products in toner powder are not classified as hazardous to health, but any dust in substantial concentration is a nuisance as it may cause respiratory tract irritation. Most vendors have recycling schemes for used toner cartridges. Loose toner must be collected carefully by using an approved toner vacuum and sealed within a strong plastic waste container. Get the manufacturer's advice about disposing of loose toner safely. It must not be sent directly to a landfill.
- **Other device and asset disposal**—Many components in PCs, cell phones, tablets, and display screens contain toxins and heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and arsenic. These toxins may be present in batteries, in circuit boards, and in plastics. These toxins are harmful to human health if ingested and are damaging to the environment. This means that you must not dispose of electronic devices as general waste in landfill or incinerators. If an electronic device cannot be donated for reuse, it must be disposed of through an approved waste management and recycling facility.

# Review
----
1. True or False? You should fit an antistatic wrist strap over your clothing as this is most likely to retain a charge.

False. The conductive path will occur through your fingers as you touch electronic components. The stud in the wrist strap must make contact with your skin to drain the charge. 

2. In which atmospheric conditions is the risk of ESD highest?

During cool, dry conditions when humidity is low. When humidity is high, the static electricity can dissipate through the moisture present in the air.

3. What care should you take when lifting a heavy object?

The main concern is damaging your back. Lift slowly and use your legs for power, not your back muscles.

4. What are the principal characteristics of a surge protector?

This is a circuit designed to protect connected devices from the effect of sudden increases or spikes in the supply voltage and/or current. Surge protectors are rated by clamping voltage (low values are better), joules rating (higher values are better), and amperage (the maximum current that can be carried).

5. You are updating a deployment checklist for installing new workstation PCs. What are the principal environmental hazards to consider when choosing a location?

Heat and direct sunlight, excessive dust and liquids, and very low or high humidity. Equipment should also be installed so as not to pose a topple or trip hazard.

6. When might you need to consult MSDS documentation?

A material safety data sheet (MSDS) should be read when introducing a new product or substance to the workplace. Subsequently, you should consult it if there is an accident involving the substance and when you need to dispose of the substance.

# Summary

### Guidelines for Implementing Operational Procedures

Follow these guidelines to implement best practice operational procedures:

- Create ticketing and incident-reporting systems to capture user information, device information, description of problems, categories, severity, and escalation levels, and ensure agents use clear, concise written communication to document the problem description, notes, and resolution.
- Develop an inventory database to assign asset IDs and manage procurement life cycle, including warranty and licensing and assigned users.
- Create SOPs to govern service requests (such as custom installation of software package, new-user setup checklist, and end-user termination checklist) and other best practice documentation (AUPs, network topology diagrams, knowledge bases, and regulatory compliance requirements).
- Develop a process and resources to structure change requests/approval (forms describing purpose and scope of the change and risk analysis) and change management (responsible staff member, rollback plan, sandbox testing, end-user acceptance, date and time of the change, and affected systems/impact).
- Develop policies and training to ensure professionalism and proper communication by support agents (professional appearance and attire, proper language, positive attitude, active listening, cultural sensitivity, timekeeping, task focus, setting and meeting expectations, respect for confidential/private materials, and ability to deal with difficult situations).
- Create best practice SOPs and provision tools to ensure personal safety (equipment grounding, disconnect power before repairing PC, lifting techniques, electrical fire safety, safety goggles, gloves, and air-filtration masks).
- Create best practice SOPs and provision environmental controls to ensure device integrity and compliance with regulations (MSDS documentation for handling and disposal of batteries, toner, and electronic waste; temperature, humidity-level awareness, and proper ventilation; dust cleanup with compressed air/vacuums and battery backup/surge suppressors to mitigate power surges, brownouts, and blackouts).
