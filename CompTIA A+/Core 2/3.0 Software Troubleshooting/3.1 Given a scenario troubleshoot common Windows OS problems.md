An operating system such as Windows provides a lot of information to assist troubleshooting, through configuration utilities and event logs. Plenty of tools are available to diagnose and recover from different kinds of problems. In this topic, you will learn which tools and techniques can help to resolve some of the common Windows OS problem symptoms.

# Boot Process
----

When a computer starts, the firmware runs a power on self-test (POST) to verify that the system components are present and functioning correctly. It then identifies a boot device and passes control to the operating system's boot loader process.

With a legacy BIOS, the firmware scans the disk identified as the boot device and reads the master boot record (MBR) in the first sector of the disk. The MBR identifies the boot sector for the partition marked as active. The boot sector loads the boot manager, which for Windows is BOOTMGR.EXE. The boot manager reads information from the boot configuration data (BCD) file, which identifies operating systems installed on the computer. BOOTMGR and the BCD are normally installed to a hidden System Reserved partition.

Assuming there is only a single Windows installation, the boot manager loads the Windows boot loader WINLOAD.EXE stored in the system root folder on the boot partition.

*If there is more than one OS installation, the boot manager shows a boot menu, allowing the user to select the installation to boot.*

WINLOAD then continues the Windows boot process by loading the kernel (NTOSKRNL.EXE), the hardware abstraction layer (HAL.DLL), and boot device drivers. Control is then passed to the kernel, which initializes and starts loading the required processes. When complete, the WINLOGON process waits for the user to authenticate.

With an EFI boot, the initial part of the boot process is different. Following POST, the firmware reads the GUID partition table (GPT) on the boot device.

The GPT identifies the EFI System Partition. The EFI system partition contains the EFI boot manager and the BCD. Each Windows installation has a subfolder under \EFI\Microsoft\ that contains a BCD and BOOTMGFW.EFI.

BOOTMGFW.EFI reads the BCD to identify whether to show a boot menu and to find the location of WINLOAD.EFI. From this point, the Windows boot loader continues the boot process by loading the kernel, as described previously.


# Boot Recovery Tools
----

To troubleshoot boot issues, you need to use options and recovery tools to access an environment in which to run tests and attempt fixes.

### Advanced Boot Options

The **Advanced Boot Options** menu allows the selection of different startup modes for troubleshooting. Startup options are displayed automatically if the system cannot start the OS. You can also invoke the menu manually. With BIOS boot, startup options are accessed by pressing **F8** before the OS loads. With UEFI, you need to reboot to show boot options. Hold the **SHIFT** key when selecting the **Restart** option from the **Power** menu on the lock screen—note that you don't have to sign in to view the power menu.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113063530.png)

Within startup options, from the first **Choose an option** screen, select **Troubleshoot**. From the next screen, select **Advanced options**. Select **Startup Settings**, and then on the next screen, select **Restart**.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113063541.png)

Press **F4** to select **Safe Mode**, or choose another option as necessary. **Safe Mode** loads only basic drivers and services required to start the system. This is a useful troubleshooting mode as it isolates reliability or performance problems to add-in drivers or application services and rules out having to fully reinstall Windows. It may also be a means of running analysis and recovery tools, such as chkdsk, System Restore, or antivirus utilities.

### WinRE and Startup Repair

If you cannot boot the computer or access startup options from the local installation, you can try booting from the product media, a repair disk, or a recovery partition. You may have to access BIOS or UEFI setup to configure the recovery media as the priority boot device.

If you don't have the product media, you can make a system repair disk from Windows using the **Create a recovery drive** setting. You need to have done this before the computer starts failing to boot or create one using a working Windows installation.

Once in the recovery environment, select the **Troubleshoot** menu and then **Advanced options**. If the boot files are damaged, you can use the **Startup Repair** option to try to fix them. You can also launch **System Restore** or restore from an image backup, perform a refresh, or reset reinstallation of Windows from here. The last two options are to run a memory diagnostic and to drop into the**Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)** command prompt, where you could run commands such as diskpart, sfc, chkdsk, bootrec, bcdedit, or regedit to try to repair the installation manually.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113063600.png)

# System Restore
----

**System Restore** allows you to roll back from system configuration changes. System Restore allows for multiple restore points to be maintained (some are created automatically) and to roll back from changes to the whole registry and reverse program installations and updates.

	`System Restore does not restore (or delete) user data files`

### Configuring System Protection

Use the **System Protection** tab (opened via the advanced **System** settings) to select which disk(s) to enable for system restore and configure how much disk capacity is used. The disk must be formatted with NTFS, have a minimum of 300 MB free space, and be over 1 GB in size.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113063703.png)
*Configuring System Protection in Win 10*


Restore points are created automatically in response to application and update installs. They are also created periodically by Task Scheduler. Windows will try to create one when it detects the PC is idle if no other restore points have been created in the last seven days. You can also create a restore point manually from this dialog.

### Using System Restore

To restore the system, open the System Restore tool (rstrui.exe). You can also run System Restore by booting from the product disk or selecting **Repair Your Computer** from the recovery environment.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113063732.png)

	System Restore does not usually reset passwords (that is, passwords will remain as they were before you ran the restore tool), but System Restore does reset passwords to what they were at the time the restore point was created if you run it from the product disk.

# Update and Driver Roll Back
----

If an update causes problems, you can try to uninstall it. You might be able to use System Restore to do this. Otherwise, open the **Programs and Features** applet and select **View installed updates**. Select the update, and then select the **Uninstall** button.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113063913.png)
*Using Programs and Features to uninstall an update*


If you are experiencing problems with a device and you have recently updated the driver, Windows also provides a Roll Back Driver feature. A new driver may not work properly because it has not been fully tested, or it may not work on your particular system. You can use Device Manager to revert to the previous driver. Right-click the device and select Properties. Select the Driver tab, and then select the Roll Back Driver button.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113064051.png)

# System Repair, Reinstall and Reimage
----

If System Restore or Startup Repair does not work and you cannot boot to a logon, you will have to use a system repair tool or possibly a reinstall option and restore from data backup (presuming you have made one). The various versions of Windows use different system recovery tools and backup processes.

### Creating and Using a Recovery Image

You can make a complete backup of the system configuration and data files as an **image**. This requires a backup device with sufficient capacity. The best compression ratio you can hope for is 2:1—so a 20 GB system will create a 10 GB image—but if the system contains a lot of files that are already heavily compressed, the ratio could be a lot lower. You also have to keep the image up-to-date or make a separate data backup.

You create a system image using the **Backup and Restore** applet in **Control Panel**. Select the **Create a system image** link in the tasks pane.

To recover the system using the backup image, use the **Advanced Boot Option** or the **System Image Recovery** option off a repair disk or recovery environment.

### Reinstalling Windows

If you do not have an up-to-date image, the last option is to reinstall Windows using the **Reset this PC** option in the recovery environment.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113064136.png)
*Win 10 Startup recovery*

Select **Keep my files** or **Remove everything** as appropriate. The **Keep my files** option can be used to repair the existing installation using either a local setup cache or by downloading the files from Microsoft's cloud servers. A reset recopies the system files and reverts all PC settings to the default, but it can preserve user personalization settings, data files, and apps installed via Windows Store. Desktop applications are removed. 

The computer will restart, and you will be prompted to sign on using an administrator account to authorize the reinstallation. Select **Reset** to continue (or **Cancel** if you have changed your mind).

If you choose to remove everything, there is a further option to securely delete information from the drive. This will take several hours but is recommended if you are giving up ownership of the PC.

# Troubleshoot Boot Issues
----

Assuming there is no underlying hardware issue, the general technique for troubleshooting **boot problems** is to determine the failure point, and therefore the missing or corrupt file. This can then be replaced, either from the source files or by using some sort of recovery disk.

### Failure to Boot/Invalid Boot Disk

If the system firmware returns an error message such as **No boot device found** or **Invalid boot disk**, then the system has completely failed to boot. The most common cause of this error used to be leaving a floppy disk in the drive on a restart. A modern cause is for the system firmware to be set to use USB for boot. Check for any removable disks, and change the boot device priority/boot order if necessary. If this message occurs when booting from a hard disk or SSD, check the connections to the drive. If the error is transitory (for example, if the message occurs a few times and then the PC starts to boot OK), it could be a sign that the fixed disk is failing. On an older system, it could be that the system firmware is having trouble detecting the drive.

### No OS Found

A **no OS found** type message can appear when a disk drive is identified as the boot device but does not report the location of the OS loader. This could indicate a faulty disk, so try running disk diagnostics (if available), and then use a recovery option to run chkdsk.

If the disk cannot be detected, enter system setup, and try modifying settings (or even resetting the default settings). If the disk's presence is reported by the system firmware but Windows still will not boot, use a startup repair tool to open a recovery mode command prompt, and use the bootrec tool to try to repair the drive's boot information.

- Enter bootrec /fixmbr to attempt repair of the MBR. Do not use this option if the disk uses GPT partitioning.
- Enter bootrec /fixboot to attempt repair of the boot sector.
- Enter bootrec /rebuildbcd to add missing Windows installations to the boot configuration database (BCD).

You could also use diskpart to ensure that the system partition is marked as active and that no other partitions have been marked as active.

### Graphical Interface Fails to Load/Black Screen

If Windows appears to boot but does not display the sign-in screen or does not load the desktop following logon, the likely cause is corruption of drivers or other system files. If the system will boot to a GUI in Safe Mode, then replace the graphics adapter driver. If the system will not boot to a GUI at all, then the Windows installation will probably have to be repaired or recovered from backup. It is also possible that the boot configuration has been changed through msconfig and just needs to be set back.

Windows is also sporadically prone to black screen issues, where nothing appears on the screen. This will often occur during update installs, where the best course of action is to give the system time to complete the update. Look for signs of continuing disk activity and spinning dots appearing on the screen. If the system does not recover from a black screen, then try searching for any currently known issues on support and troubleshooting sites. You can use the key sequence **START+CTRL+SHIFT+B** to test whether the system is responsive. There should be a beep and the display may reinitialize.

If the problem occurs frequently, use chkdsk and sfc to verify system file integrity. Also, consider either an update or rollback of the graphics adapter driver.

# Troubleshoot Profile Issues
----

If Windows does boot, but only **slowly**, you need to try to identify what is happening to delay the process. You can enable verbose status messages during the Windows load sequence by configuring a system policy or applying a registry setting to enable **Display highly detailed status messages**.

Delays affecting the system prior to sign-in are caused by loading drivers and services. Quite often the culprit will be some type of network service or configuration not working optimally, but there could be some sort of file corruption too.

If the system is slow to load the desktop following sign-in, the issue could be a corrupt user profile. The registry settings file NTUSER.DAT is particularly prone to this. **Rebuilding a local user profile** means creating a new account and then copying files from the old, corrupt profile to the new one, but excluding the following files: NTUSER.DAT, NTUSER.DAT.LOG, and NTUSER.INI.

# Troubleshoot Performance Issues
----

**Sluggish performance** can have many causes. Use the following general procedure to try to quantify the degree to which the system is “slow” and identify probable causes:

1. Use Task Manager to determine if any resources are at 90–100% utilization, and then note which process is most active. You may need to identify a particular Windows service running within a svchost.exe process. Windows Update/Installer, the SuperFetch/Prefetch caching engine, Windows Telemetry data collection, Windows Search/Indexing, and Windows Defender (or third-party security software) are often the culprits.
2. Wait for these processes to complete—if there is a mix of CPU, memory, and disk activity, then the process is probably operating normally, but slowly. If there is no disk activity or, conversely, if disk activity does not drop from 100%, the process could have stalled.
3. If the process or system continues to be unresponsive, you can either restart the service or kill the task process.
4. If ending the process doesn't restore system performance, try **rebooting** the computer. The problem could be transitory and might not reoccur.

	`Rather than simply rebooting, you might want to fully power down the machine, disconnect it from the supply for 30 seconds, and then power back on. This  ensures that all data is completly cleared from caches and system memory`

5. If the service or process becomes unresponsive again after restarting, disable it (if possible) and check with the software vendor for any known problems.
6. If Windows displays an error message such as **Low memory**, try running fewer programs, and see if the issue can be isolated to one process. The software might have a memory leak fault that will need to be fixed by the vendor. If the issue only occurs when the user tries to run more programs, either the system will need to be fitted with more system RAM or the user will need to lower his or her expectations for multitasking.
7. If Windows displays an error message such as **Low disk space**, use Disk Clean-up to delete unnecessary files. If the problem keeps recurring, check for any unusual behavior by an application, such as excessive logging or temp file creation. If you can rule out these as issues, the system will need additional storage.

If you can't identify overutilization as a probable cause, consider the following troubleshooting techniques and solutions:

- **Apply updates**—Check for any missing Windows and application updates and install the latest drivers for hardware devices.
- **Defragment the hard drive**—Running defrag regularly on a hard disk drive (HDD) improves file I/O by putting files into contiguous clusters. Also make sure there is sufficient free disk space.
- **Verify OS and app hardware requirements, and add resources if necessary**—As well as consulting the official system requirements, check resource utilization using Task Manager, Resource Monitor, or (for more extended periods) Performance Monitor. If CPU, system memory, disk, or network resources are continually stretched, then the system will have to be upgraded. For example, Windows performance when installed to a hard disk is not nearly as good as when installed to an SSD.
- **Disable startup items**—Use the System Configuration Utility (msconfig) or Task Manager to prevent unnecessary services and programs from running at startup. If you need to run the services, consider setting them to delayed startup or manual startup to avoid slowing down boot times too much. If a service is not required and is causing problems, you can set it to Disabled to prevent it from being started. Note that some security-critical services (such as Windows Update) can be re-enabled automatically by the OS.
- **Scan the computer for viruses and other malware, but also check the configuration of antivirus software**—While necessary to protect against malware threats, security scanning software can reduce system performance. Try disabling scanning temporarily to test whether performance improves. Make sure the software is configured to exclude Windows system files it shouldn't scan, and configure any exceptions for software applications recommended by the vendor. These typically include database files and the image files used for virtual hard disks.
- **Check for power management issues**—If the user has been closing sessions using sleep or hibernate, try restarting the computer. Verify that the system is not operating in a power-saving mode (CPU throttling). Be aware that this might have an underlying cause, such as overheating.

# Troubleshoot System Fault issues
----

A **blue screen of death (BSoD)** displays a Windows STOP error. A STOP error is one that causes Windows to halt. STOP errors can occur when Windows loads or while it is running. Most BSoDs, especially those that occur during startup, are caused by faulty hardware or hardware drivers. Use the following procedures to try to troubleshoot the issue:

- Use System Restore or (if you can boot to Safe Mode) driver rollback, or update rollback to restore the system to a working state.
- Remove a recently added hardware device, or uninstall a recently installed program.
- Check seating of hardware components and cables.
- Run hardware diagnostics, chkdsk, and scan for malware.
- Check fans and chassis vents for dust and clean if necessary.
- Make a note of the stop error code (which will be in the form: Stop: 0x0...), and search the Microsoft Knowledge Base (support.microsoft.com/search) for known fixes and troubleshooting tips. The various newsgroups accessible from this site offer another valuable source of assistance.
- ![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113064553.png)

	`If the system auto restarts after a blue screen and you cannot read the error, open the **Advanced Options** menu, and select the **Disable automatic restarts** option. This option can also be set from **Advanced System Properties > Startup and Recovery Settings**.`

### System Instability and Frequent Shutdowns

A system that exhibits instability will freeze, shutdown, reboot, or power off without any sort of error message. This type of error suggests an overheating problem, a power problem, a CPU/chipset/RAM issue, or corrupt kernel files.

Windows includes a **Windows Memory Diagnostics** tool to test memory chips for errors. You can either run the tool from **Administrative Tools** or boot to the recovery environment. The computer will restart and run the test. Press **F1** if you want to configure test options.

If errors are found, first check that all the memory modules are correctly seated. Remove all the memory modules but one and retest. You should be able to identify the faulty board by a process of elimination. If a known-good memory module is reported faulty, the problem is likely to lie in the motherboard.

If you suspect file system corruption, use sfc C: to scan the boot volume. If the tool reports errors, run sfc C: /f to attempt repairs.

### USB Issues

If there are issues with USB devices not working after connection, not working after the computer resumes from sleep/hibernation, or generating warning messages, make sure the controllers are using the latest driver:

1. Use Windows Update or the vendor site to obtain the latest chipset or system driver. There may also be a specific USB 3 host controller driver.
2. Use Device Manager to uninstall each USB host controller device, and then reboot to reinstall them with the new driver.
3. If this does not resolve the issue, disable USB selective suspend power management either for a specific port or device or system-wide.

A **USB controller resource warning** indicates that too many devices are connected to a single controller. This typically occurs if you use an unpowered USB hub to expand the number of ports available and connect more than five devices to a single controller. If updating the chipset drivers doesn’t resolve the issue, try the following:

1. Connect the hub to a USB 2 port rather than a USB 3 port. While USB 3 is higher bandwidth, in some chipset implementations each controller supports fewer device connections (endpoints). Use the hub to connect low-bandwidth input/output devices over USB 2, and reserve use of USB 3 ports for external disks and network adapters.
2. Reduce the number of devices to see if that solves the problem. If it doesn’t, test to see if one device is the source of the errors.

# Troubleshoot Application and Service Fault Issues
----

As well as system-wide issues, some errors may be isolated to a particular application or background service.

### Applications Crashing

If an **application crashes**, the priority is to try to preserve any data that was being processed. Users should be trained to save regularly, but modern suites such as Microsoft Office are configured to save recovery files regularly, minimizing the chance of data loss. If enabled, the Windows File History feature or using OneDrive cloud storage can also function as a continuous backup for file versions.

Try to give the process time to become responsive again, and establish if you need to try to recover data from temporary files or folders. When you have done all you can to preserve data, use Task Manager to end the process. If the application crashes continually, check the event logs for any possible causes. Try to identify whether the cause lies in processing a particular data file or not.

If you cannot identify a specific cause of a problem, the generic solution is to check for an application **update** that addresses the issue. Remember that applications need to be updated independently of Windows Update. The option is usually located in the Help menu. If an update does not fix the problem, the next step is to **uninstall then reinstall** or perform a repair installer if that is supported. Sometimes the Windows installer fails to remove every file and registry setting; if this is the case, then following manual uninstall instructions might help.

### Services Not Starting

If you see a message such as **One or more services failed to start** during the Windows load sequence, check Event Viewer and/or the Services snap-in to identify which service has failed. Troubleshooting services can be complex, but bear the following general advice in mind:

- Try to start or restart the service manually—As most computers run a lot of services at startup, some can sometimes become "stuck." If a service is not a critical dependency for other services, it may help to set it to delayed start.
- Verify that disabling one service has not inadvertently affected others—Some services cannot start until a dependent service is running.
- Make sure that the service has sufficient privileges—Services depend on account permissions to run. Check that the service is associated with a valid user or system account and that the password configured for the account is correct.
- If a core Windows service is affected, check system files, and scan the disk for errors and malware.
- If an application service is affected, try reinstalling the application.
- Use regsvr32 to re-register the software component—a dynamic link library (DLL)—that the service relies upon.
- Check whether the service is suppose to run—Faulty software uninstall routines can leave "orphan" registry entries and startup shortcuts. Use the System Configuration Utility (msconfig) or Registry Editor (regedit) to look for orphaned items.

### Time Drift

Processes such as authentication and backup depend on the time reported by the local PC being closely synchronized to the time kept by a server. Some authentication systems are intolerant of 30 or 60 second discrepancies.

Each PC motherboard has a battery-powered real time clock (RTC) chip, but this is not a reliable authoritative time source. Relying on the internal time can lead to servers and clients **drifting out of sync**, especially if some of the clients access the network remotely. Servers and clients can also be configured to use Internet time sources, but if some clients are remote, they may be set to use different sources than the network servers.

Ideally, the network services should be configured in a domain and use either GPS-synchronized time sources or a pool of Internet time sources. Sampling from a pool helps to identify and resolve drifts. The clients can then be configured to use the servers as authoritative time sources.

# Review
----

1. A user calls saying that their screen occasionally goes blue, and the system shuts down. What should you advise the user to do?

Record as much information from the user's blue screen as possible, especially the STOP error number,so that you can research the error.

2. A program is continually using 99–100% of processor time. What should you do?

Try to end the application or the process using Task Manager, and then contact the application vendor to find out why the problem is occurring.

3. You are assisting a user whose application is in the state shown in the exhibit. How would you troubleshoot this problem?
	1. ![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113064723.png)

The user will be concerned about losing any unsaved work. Ask the user to describe what he or she was doing at the time of the crash to try to diagnose what might have caused it. Give the program a few minutes to finish processing—check Task Manager for ongoing disk activity. If the application does not start responding, check autosave and temp folders for a recent copy of the file data. Use Task Manager to end the process. Restart the application, and try to open any file data you might have recovered. Check the log files and online resources to try to diagnose the cause of the crash. If the problem persists, consider solutions such as disabling add-ons or reinstalling. Demonstrate to the user how to set up autosave (if it is not already configured) and how to save regularly.

4. A computer is caught in a reboot loop. It starts, shows a BSoD, and then reboots. What should you do?

Boot using a recovery tool, such as the product disc, and attempt startup repair and/or repair of the Windows installation using sfc or Windows reset.

5. If you suspect improper handling during installation has caused damage to a RAM module, how could you test that suspicion?

Run a Memory Diagnostic. Because this tests each RAM cell, it should uncover any fault.
