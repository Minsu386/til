The troubleshooting techniques you use for PCs and laptops are similar to the ones needed for resolving issues on mobile-device operating systems and applications. One difference is that apps, operating system, and hardware are tightly integrated in mobile devices. You may need to troubleshoot all three components to determine which one is causing the issue.

# Mobile Device Troubleshooting Tools
----

When troubleshooting a mobile device, you will commonly use the Settings app. The layout of this app is different for iOS and Android and can vary between versions. In Android, you will often need to use the notification bar (swipe down from the top of the screen) and list of all apps (swipe up from the bottom). In iOS, the Control Center can be accessed by swiping from the top-right corner (newer models) or bottom of the screen.

*Access the iOS Control Center (Left) by swiping from the top-right and Android notification drawer by swiping from the top. These contain shortcuts for enabling or disabling radios and other features.*

### Reboot

Just as turning it off and on again is the tried and trusted method of "fixing" a computer, a reboot can often resolve a transitory performance or stability issue on a mobile device. Users generally leave their mobile devices in a sleep state. Powering the device off closes all applications and clears any data from RAM. Data and settings stored in the device are not affected. This kind of soft reset is usually effective in restoring unresponsive or frozen systems and is one of the first things to try when faced with a malfunctioning app or slow performance:

- On iOS, hold the **Side/Top** button for a few seconds to bring up the Power Off option. When you are troubleshooting, leave the device powered off for a minute, and then restart by holding the **Side/Top** button again. You can perform a forced restart by: 1. pressing Volume Up, 2. pressing Volume Down, and 3. holding the Side/Top button. The screen will go black, and then the device will restart.
- On Android, hold the physical **Power** button for a few seconds to bring up the **Power Off** prompt. If the touchscreen is unresponsive, a forced restart can often be performed by holding the **Power** button for 10 seconds, though some Android devices use a different button combination for this. You can also boot an Android device to Safe Mode by tap-and-holding the **Power Off** message. Safe Mode disables third-party apps but leaves core services running.

### Factory Reset

A factory reset removes all user data, apps, and settings. The device will either have to be manually reconfigured with a new user account and reloaded apps or restored from a backup configuration. When you are performing a factory reset, ensure that the device has a full battery charge or is connected to an external power source.

- To factory reset an iOS device, use the option on the General page in Settings.
- For Android, you should check for specific instructions for each particular device. On stock Android, you can initiate a reset from the **System > Advanced** section of **Settings**. 

	`You might be required to sign in immediately after performing a factory restore to protect against theft of the device or your account information. Make sure you have the account credentials available, and do not attempt a factory reset within 72 hours of changing your account password.
`

# Troubleshoot Device and OS Issues
----

If rebooting the device does not fix an issue, use the following steps to troubleshoot specific problems. If these do not work, try a factory reset.

### OS Fails to Update

An **OS update failure** is a serious issue as it could leave the device exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities.

1. Use the vendor site to verify that the update is compatible with the device model.
2. Connect the device to building power and Wi-Fi. An update may be blocked when there is insufficient battery charge or when the device is connected to a metered network.
3. Restart the device and then try the update again.
4. Check that there is sufficient free space on the device. In iOS, use **Settings > General > Storage** and on Android use **Settings > Storage**.

### Device Randomly Reboots

A device that **randomly reboots** might be overheating, have a low battery charge, or have a faulty battery or other hardware. You can use the Settings menu to check battery health, and there are third-party diagnostic apps that can report hardware faults. If a hardware issue can be discounted, verify that the device has sufficient storage available and check for OS and/or app updates. Otherwise, try to isolate the issue to a single faulty app and uninstall it.

### Device Is Slow to Respond

If you can rule out hardware causes such as throttling due to high temperature or low battery charge, a device that is **slow to respond** can be an indication of resources being inadequate (too many open apps) or badly written apps that overutilize memory or other resources. A reboot will usually fix the problem in the short term. If the problem is persistent, either try to identify whether the problem is linked to running a particular app or try freeing space by removing data or apps.

You should also consider any recently installed apps. Having many apps that run some sort of monitoring or connectivity check in the background or apps that display real-time content in a home screen widget will impact performance. You can use Battery settings to investigate which apps are consuming most resources. Alternatively, a third-party system monitor app could be installed to report utilization information.

	`Vendors try to support device models for as long as possible, but it is frequently the case that major (or sometimes minor) version updates can quite severely impact performance when applied to older devices. Unfortunately, vendors tend not to provide a rollback option for version updates. You can only report the issue and hope the vendor supplies a fix.`

### Screen Does Not Autorotate

When the **screen does not autorotate**, there could be a hardware fault. To rule out simple causes, complete the following checks:

1. Use the notification drawer or Control Center to check that rotation lock is not enabled.
	1. ![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113070242.png)
		* In iOS (left), enabling the rotation lock from Control Center prevents the device from autorotating. The screenshot shows that the lock is currently unhighlighted (off). In Android (right), enabling the autorotate button allows the screen to reorient automatically, while disabling it locks the orientation*
2. Check that the user is not touching any part of the screen as this will prevent rotation.
3. Consider that some apps can only be used in a single orientation. These might also interfere with other apps, so try closing apps via the task list. To show the task list:

- On iOS, either double-tap the physical Home button or swipe up from the bottom to the middle of the screen.
- On Android, select the square button from the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.

	`In Android, when autorotate is disabled, an icon is added to the navigation bar allowing the user to change the orientation manually. In iOS, a manual control can be added via the AssistiveTouch option, which is enabled via Accessibility settings.`

# Troubleshoot App Issues
----

A mobile OS performs sophisticated memory management to be able to run multiple applications while allowing each app to have sufficient resources and preventing an app from consuming excessive amounts of power and draining the battery. The memory management routines shift apps between foreground (in active use), background (potentially accessing the network and other resources), and suspended (not using any resources).

If an **app fails to launch, fails to close, or crashes**, first use force stop to quit it and try launching again:

- In Android, open **Settings > Apps**. Tap an app, then select the **Force Stop** option to close it or the **Disable** option to make it unavailable.
- In iOS, clearing an app from the multitasking list also force stops it. Either swipe up or double tap the physical **Home** button, then swipe the app up off the screen.
![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231113070511.png)

*In Android, tap the square multitasking button (bottom-right) to view open apps, then swipe up to remove them. Tap the app icon and select App info to use the Force Stop option or clear the app cache*

If this doesn’t work, you can try clearing the app cache either from within the app or (in Android) using the Clear Cache option under App info.

If the app is still unresponsive, reboot the device. If the problem persists, use the store to check whether an update is pending and install it if so. You can use the app’s page to check whether there are any reported issues. If an **app fails to update**, check that it is compatible with the current OS version. Also verify that there is sufficient storage space and that there is an Internet connection.

Another stock response to an app issue is to uninstall and then reinstall it.

- To uninstall an iOS app, tap-and-hold it until it wiggles, then press the **X** icon and confirm by pressing **Delete**. To return the screen to normal, press the **Home** button. Note that you cannot uninstall default apps.
- In Android, use **Settings > Apps** to uninstall (completely remove) or disable (prevent from running) apps. You can also long-press an icon on the home screen, then drag it to the **Uninstall** icon (dragging it to **Remove** just hides the app icon).

The user's account lists previously used and purchased apps, even when they are removed from a device. Reinstall the app via the store.

	`Also consider that mobile device management (MDM) software might prevent an app or function from running in a certain context. Security policies might prevent use of the camera within the corporate office, for instance, and any app that requires the camera might then fail to start.
`
	`If an iPhone or iPad does not update over wireless, you can try attaching it to a macOS device or Windows PC using a Lightning or Lightning-to-USB cable. In macOS Catalina or later, iOS devices can be managed via Finder. In earlier versions and in Windows, they are managed via the iTunes application.`


# Troubleshoot Connectivity Issues
----

etworking is another area where problems occur frequently. On a mobile device, that means troubleshooting connectivity issues with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. To approach these problems, try to establish whether there is some sort of hardware/interference problem or a configuration error.

### Signal Strength and Interference Issues

Radio signals can be affected by the distance between the broadcast and reception antennas and by interference from other devices or by barriers such as thick walls or metal. On a mobile, be aware that the radio is less powerful than the one on a computer and that a low battery charge will weaken the signal strength. Try moving the device closer to the access point or paired Bluetooth device. Try removing a device case or changing the way it is held, as these things can sometimes interfere with the antenna.

	`Remember that Bluetooth range is less than Wi-Fi (up to about 10 meters or 30 feet).`

### Configuration Issues

Use the notification drawer or Control Center to check that the device is not in airplane mode and that an individual radio function has not been disabled. Next, use Settings to verify that the Wi-Fi network parameters or Bluetooth pairing information is correct. Try removing/forgetting the network or Bluetooth pair and reconnecting.

With Wi-Fi, verify that the access point supports the same 802.11 standard as the device. For example, an access point configured to use 802.11ac only will not be accessible to a smartphone with an 802.11n adapter. The access point must be put into compatibility mode. Also remember that some mobile devices support 2.4 GHz radios only and will not be able to connect to a network on the 5 GHz band.

If you can rule out any other configuration errors, consider obtaining an OS or firmware update for the device or for the access point. Research any known issues between the access point and the model of device.

### Troubleshooting Near-field Communication

A near-field communication (NFC) issue typically manifests when trying to make payments via a contactless card reader. The device must be unlocked to authorize the payment and enable NFC. Verify that the NFC sensor is supported and enabled for the wallet app and that airplane mode is not active. Try holding the device closer to the reader and for longer.

### Troubleshooting AirDrop Issues

**AirDrop** is an iOS feature that allows file transfer between iOS and macOS devices over a Bluetooth connection. The sender must be listed in the recipient’s contacts list, or AirDrop must be configured to receive files from everyone. Check that the feature is enabled and correctly configured under **Settings > General > AirDrop**, and ensure that the devices are within range for a Bluetooth link.

Android supports a similar feature referred to asNearby Share (Settings > Google > Devices > Nearby Share).

# Review
----

1. True or false? A factory reset preserves the user's personal data.

False. Restoring to factory settings means removing all user data and settings.

2. You are updating an internal support knowledge base with advice for troubleshooting mobile devices. What is the first step to take if a user reports that an app will not start?

Use force stop if available and/or reboot the device.

3. You are troubleshooting a user device that keeps powering off unexpectedly. You run hardware diagnostics and confirm there is no component fault or overheating issue. What should your next troubleshooting step be?

Check that the device has sufficient spare storage, and check for updates. If you can’t identify a device-wide fault, test to see whether the issue is associated with use of a single app.
