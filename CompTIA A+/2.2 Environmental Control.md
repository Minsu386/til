This lesson covers the following topics:

- Disposal
- Air quality
- Cleaning

### Disposal

It is important to ensure that equipment and hazardous chemicals are disposed of properly.

- Consult the manufacturer's documentation for recommended solutions for equipment disposal.
- Consult an MSDS for information on physical data, toxicity, health effects, first aid, storage, disposal, and spill procedures for disposal of hazardous chemicals. You can download a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) from the manufacturer's website or check with a representative of that organization. Your company may also have an MSDS in place for disposal that you can refer to.

The following table offers suggestions for disposing of used equipment:

|Component or Material|Disposal Method|
|---|---|
|Alkaline batteries|Recycle alkaline batteries if possible. Otherwise, dispose of alkaline batteries as your local laws require. For example, in some states, you can throw them in the regular trash. In California, they are considered hazardous waste and are supposed to go with the household hazardous waste collection for special recycling.|
|Button batteries|These are considered hazardous waste because they contain mercuric oxide, lithium, silver oxide, or zinc-air. Return them to the manufacturer, recycle them, or contact local authorities for disposal procedures.|
|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries|Recycle NiMH batteries. Lithium batteries are considered a non-hazardous waste.|
|CRT monitor|Contact local authorities for recycling CRTs. They contain many toxic and caustic substances that are illegal to incinerate. Discharge CRTs before disposal, as they can contain high voltages.|
|PC system|Recycle, give it away, or resell old PC systems. A typical PC contains $5 to $25 worth of precious metals. Remember to clean the hard drive before disposing of the machine.|
|Power supply|Contact local authorities for regulations. Recycle power supplies if possible. Discharge before disposal, as they contain high voltages.|
|Laser printer toner cartridges|Return cartriges to the manufacturer for recycling (to clean up spills, use a toner vacuum or a scoop and a damp cloth; never use a regular vacuum).|
|Inkjet printer cartridges|Recycle these cartridges. You can return the cartridges to the manufacturer for recycling or recycle them yourself.|
|Cleaning solutions and solvents|Consult the MSDS, a licensed disposal organization, or local authorities for handling and authorized disposal procedures for solutions and solvents.|

## Air Quality

Computer systems do not function well if they get too cold or too hot or too humid or too dry. Poor environmental conditions can reduce the life of network components, as well as decrease their reliability over time.

The following chart provides information on a few air quality factors.

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|Temperature|The hotter computer equipment runs, the faster it ages and degrades. And if a system is hot enough, it is possible for hardware components to be destroyed.<br><br>- Internal fans and cooling systems can typically maintain the internal temperature of your computers.<br>- External temperatures of offices, server rooms, and data centers should be monitored.<br>- The general guideline is to try to keep the temperature at 68-degrees Fahrenheit, but cooler temperatures can be even better especially in server rooms and data centers where there are a lot of systems close together.|
|Humidity|Computer systems do not function well with too much or too little humidity. Computers are designed to operate within a humidity range, so you need to monitor the humidity within your organization, especially in your server rooms and data centers. Too much humidity can result in condensation. Too little humidity can result in electrostatic discharges. The drier the air, the more easily static sparks can jump and damage components. The recommended humidity level is usually between 40 and 60%.|
|Ventilation|Good ventilation can go a long way in maintaining temperature, humidity, and airflow. PCs and laptops should be used in an area where there is plenty of space for air to flow in and out. Server rooms and data centers often use hot and cold aisles that are designed to ensure that hot air is removed, and cool air is pushed into the room.|

## Cleaning

A buildup of dirt and dust can slow or even stop mechanical parts and cause your computer to overheat.

The following cleaning tools can be used to maintain your systems:

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|Computer vacuum|Used to remove small bits of dust and dirt. Be careful using near small components.|
|Damp cloth|A damp cloth with mild soap and water can be used to clean the outside of a computer and monitor. Be sure to unplug any electronic device before cleaning with water.|
|Denatured isopropyl alcohol|Denatured alcohol can be used to clean metal contacts (like those found on expansion cards).|
|Compressed air|Use compressed air to blow small particles of dust and dirt from inside your device.|








## 2.2.3 Power Concerns
----
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Conditions
- Devices

## Conditions

The following table lists power conditions you should be familiar with:

|Condition|Description|
|---|---|
|Surge|Over-voltage that lasts seconds|
|Spike|Over-voltage that lasts milliseconds|
|Sag|Under-voltage that lasts milliseconds|
|Brownout|Under-voltage that lasts seconds (lights may dim)|
|Blackout|Complete power failure|

## Devices

The following is a description of devices used to prevent power problems:

|Device|Description|
|---|---|
|Surge suppressor|A surge suppressor conditions power so that over-voltages don't reach devices.|
|Surge protector|A surge protector protects against over-voltages by switching a device off before an over-voltage can damage it.<br><br>- A power strip provides multiple power outlets from a single plug-in but is not necessarily a surge protector.<br>- Surge protectors can be destroyed by surges and lose their ability to protect.<br>- Consider using a surge protector with an indicator light to show whether it is working correctly.|
|Line conditioner|A _line conditioner_ modifies the power signal to remove noise and create a smooth alternating current (AC) signal.|
|Standby power supply  <br>(SPS)|A _standby power supply_ is an offline device that switches over to provide power when an under-voltage occurs. If the switchover is not fast enough, the computer loses power.|
|Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)|An _uninterruptible power supply_ is an online device that is constantly providing battery power to the computer and being recharged by the wall outlet.<br><br>- There are two types of UPS systems:<br>    - An online UPS constantly powers the computer from the battery.<br>    - An offline UPS powers the computer from the wall power. When the power fails, a switch inside the UPS switches to power the computer from the battery. This is the most common form of UPS.<br>- UPS size is measured by the volt-amp (VA) rating. The capacity of the UPS determines the number of devices and how long the devices can run when power is interrupted.<br>- When purchasing a UPS, purchase one with enough battery power to power only critical devices such as the computer and a single monitor.<br>    - To reduce the amount of power required by the UPS, do not plug non-critical devices into the UPS.<br>    - Laser printers require more power than most UPS systems are capable of providing. For this reason, you should not connect a laser printer to a UPS. If you must provide power to a laser printer, get a dedicated UPS for that device.<br>- A UPS is designed to provide enough power to shut a system down safely during an extended power outage. Most are not intended as long-term power solutions.<br>- The UPS connects to the power source (usually a wall socket), the computer plugs into the UPS, and the UPS is connected through a serial or USB port to the computer. Software on the computer uses this connection to monitor battery life and to detect when the regular power is lost. You can configure the software to shut the system down automatically when the battery charge reaches a certain level. You usually need to configure the following settings when working with UPS software:<br>    - Time to wait before sending a warning to clients.<br>    - Time to wait before beginning a shutdown.<br>    - Name of programs or commands to run during the shutdown.<br>- In addition to providing power when the power is lost, most UPS systems also condition the line and remove power spikes and sags.<br>- Most UPS devices sound an alarm when the AC power is lost. This alarm continues until AC power is restored, although many UPS devices have a switch to mute the alarm.|

During certain conditions, such as an electrical storm or when the power supply is constantly going up or down, you might need to unplug the computer to protect it. Simply turning it off might still damage the components because some power remains supplied to the system. In the case of an electrical storm, keeping the system plugged in leaves it susceptible to power spikes.
