## Fiber
----
The major obstacle to providing internet access that can perform like a LAN is bandwidth in the last mile, where the copper wiring infrastructure is often low grade. The projects to update this wiring to use **fiber** optic links are referred to by the umbrella term fiber to the X (FTTx).

### Fiber to the Curb and VDSL

A fiber to the curb (FTTC) solution retains some sort of copper wiring to the customer premises while extending the fiber link from the point of presence to a communications cabinet servicing multiple subscribers. The service providers with their roots in telephone networks use very high-speed DSL (VDSL) to support FTTC. VDSL achieves higher bit rates than other DSL types at the expense of range. It allows for both symmetric and asymmetric modes. Over 300 m (1,000 feet), an asymmetric link supports 52 Mbps downstream and 6 Mbps upstream, while a symmetric link supports 26 Mbps in both directions. VDSL2 specifies a very short range (100 m/300 feet) rate of 100 Mbps (bi-directional).

### Fiber to the Premises and Optical Network Terminals

A fiber to the premises (FTTP) Internet connection means that the service provider’s fiber optic cable is run all the way to the customer’s building. This full fiber connection type is implemented as a passive optical network (PON). In a PON, a single fiber cable is run from the point of presence to an optical line terminal (OLT) located in a street cabinet. From the OLT, splitters direct each subscriber’s traffic over a shorter length of fiber to an optical network terminal (ONT) installed at the customer’s premises. The ONT converts the optical signal to an electrical one. The ONT is connected to the customer’s router using an RJ45 copper wire patch cord.

## Cable
----
A cable Internet connection is usually available as part of a cable access TV (CATV) service. A CATV network is often described as hybrid fiber coax (HFC), as it combines a fiber optic core network with copper coaxial cable links to customer premises equipment. It can also be described as broadband cable or just as cable. Cable based on the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) supports downlink speeds of up to 38 Mbps (North America) or 50 Mbps (Europe) and uplinks of up to 27 Mbps. DOCSIS version 3 allows the use of multiplexed channels to achieve higher bandwidth.

Installation of a **cable modem** follows the same general principles as for a DSL modem. The cable modem is interfaced to the local router via an RJ45 port and with the access provider's network by a short segment of coax terminated using threaded F-type connectors. More coax then links all the premises in a street with a cable modem termination system (CMTS), which forwards data traffic via the fiber backbone to the ISP's point of presence and from there to the internet.

## Cellular Radio Internet Connection 
----
The 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands used by Wi-Fi have limited range, while fixed wireless internet requires a large dish antenna. **Cellular radio** wireless networking facilitates communications over much larger distances using mobile devices. Cellular networking is also used by some Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart energy meters.

Cellular digital communications standards are described as belonging to a particular generation. 

### 3G

A 3G cellular radio makes a connection to the closest base station. The area served by each base station is referred to as a "cell." Cells can have an effective range of up to 5 miles (8 km), though signals can be obstructed by building materials. A 3G cellular radio typically works in the 850 and 1,900 MHz frequency bands (mostly in the Americas) and the 900 and 1,800 MHz bands (rest of the world). These lower frequency waves do not need so much power to propagate over long distances.

With 3G cellular, there are two competing formats, established in different markets:

- Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)-based phones. GSM allows subscribers to use a removable subscriber identity module (SIM) card to use an unlocked handset with their chosen network provider.
- Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-based handsets. With CDMA, the handset is directly managed by the provider and there is no removable SIM card.

### 4G

Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is a series of converged 4G standards supported by both the GSM and CDMA network providers. LTE devices must have a SIM card issued by the network provider installed.

### 5G

The 5G standard uses different spectrum bands from low (sub-6 GHz) to medium/high (20–60 GHz). Low bands have greater range and penetrating power; high bands, also referred to as millimeter wave (mmWave), require close range (a few hundred feet) and cannot penetrate walls or windows. Consequently, design and rollout of 5G services is relatively complex. Rather than a single large antenna serving a wide area wireless cell, 5G involves installing many smaller antennas to form an array that can take advantage of multipath and beamforming to overcome the propagation limitations of the spectrum. This technology is referred to as massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO).

As well as faster speeds for mobile device internet connections, 4G and 5G can be used as a fixed-access wireless broadband solution for homes and businesses and to support IoT networks.

## Fixed Wireless Internet Access (Satellite & WISP))
----
Wired broadband internet access is not always available, especially in rural areas or older building developments, where running new cable capable of supporting DSL or full fiber is problematic. In this scenario, some sort of fixed wireless internet access might be an option.

## Geostationary Orbital Satellite Internet Access

A **satellite**-based microwave radio system provides far bigger areas of coverage than can be achieved using other technologies. The transfer rates available vary between providers and access packages, but 2 or 6 Mbps up and 30 Mbps down would be typical.

One drawback of satellites placed in a high geostationary orbit is increased latency. The signal must travel over thousands of miles more than terrestrial connections, introducing a delay of many times what might be expected over a land link. For example, if accessing an internet web server over DSL involves a 10–20 ms round trip time (RTT) delay on the link, accessing the same site over a satellite link could involve a 600–800 ms RTT delay. This is an issue for real-time applications, such as video conferencing, VoIP, and multiplayer gaming.

*RTT is the Two-Way latency, or the time taken for a probe to be sent and a response to be received*

To create a satellite internet connection, the ISP installs a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) satellite dish antenna at the customer's premises and aligns it with the orbital satellite. The satellites are in high geostationary orbit above the equator, so in the northern hemisphere, the dish will be pointing south. Because the satellite does not move relative to the dish, there should be no need for any realignment. The antenna is connected via coaxial cabling to a Digital Video Broadcast Satellite (DVB-S) modem.
## Low Earth Orbital Satellite Internet Access

A different type of service uses an array of satellites positioned in low Earth orbit (LEO). LEO satellites support better bandwidth (around 70–100 Mbps at the time of writing) and are lower latency (100–200 ms RTT). The drawback is that the satellites move relative to the surface of the Earth. The customer's premises antenna must be provisioned with a motor so that it can periodically realign with the array. The dish construction uses a technology called "phased array" to connect to different satellites as they pass overhead and minimize the amount of mechanical realignment required. The antenna must have a clear view of the whole sky.

## Wireless Internet Service Providers

A **wireless internet service provider (WISP)** uses ground-based long-range fixed access wireless technology. The WISP installs and maintains a directional antenna to work as a bridge between the customer’s network and the service provider. A WISP might use Wi-Fi type networking or proprietary equipment and licensed or unlicensed frequency bands.A fixed access wireless link is often low latency, or at least, lower latency than satellite. A disadvantage of fixed access wireless is that the actual unobstructed line of sight between the two antennas can be difficult to maintain. If the provider uses unlicensed frequencies, there are risks of interference from other wireless networks and devices.

*All types of microwave Radio link can be adversely affected by snow, rain and high winds*

# Network Types

## LANS AND WANS
----
A **local area network (LAN)** is a group of computers connected by cabling and one or more network switches that are all installed at a single geographical location. A LAN might span a single floor in a building, a whole building, or multiple nearby buildings (a campus). Any network where the nodes are within about 1 or 2 km (or about 1 mile) of one another can be thought of as "local." LAN cabling and devices are typically owned and managed by the organization that uses the network.

Most cabled LANs are based on the 802.3 Ethernet standards maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE 802.3 standards are designated _x_BASE-_Y_, where _x_ is the nominal data rate and _Y_ is the cable type. For example:

- 100BASE-T refers to Fast Ethernet over copper twisted pair cabling. Fast Ethernet works at 100 Mbps.
- 1000BASE-T refers to Gigabit Ethernet over copper twisted pair cabling. Gigabit Ethernet works at 1000 Mbps (or 1 Gbps). 1000BASE-T is the mainstream choice of standard for most LANs.
- 10GBASE-T refers to a copper cabling standard working at 10 Gbps.

Copper cabling uses electrical signaling to communicate data. Other types of Ethernet work over fiber optic cabling. Fiber uses pulses of light to communicate data.

### Wireless LANs

A **wireless local area network (WLAN)** uses radios and antennas for data transmission and reception. Most WLANs are based on the IEEE 802.11 series of standards. IEEE 802.11 is better known by its brand name, Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi and Ethernet technologies complement one another and are often used together as segments within the same local network. This allows computers with wired and wireless networking adapters to communicate with one another.

### Wide Area Networks

Where a LAN operates at a single site, a **wide area network (WAN)** spans multiple geographic locations. One example of a WAN is the Internet, a global network of networks. A company dedicated to facilitating access to the Internet from local networks is called an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Most private or enterprise WANs use cabling and equipment leased from an ISP to interconnect two or more LAN sites. For example, a company might use a WAN to connect branch office sites to the LAN at its head office. 

### Metropolitan Area Networks

M**etropolitan area network (MAN)** can be used to mean a specific network type covering an area equivalent to a city or other municipality. It could mean a company with multiple connected networks within the same metropolitan area—so, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

## Personal Area Network
A **personal area network (PAN)** refers to using wireless connectivity to connect to devices at a range of a few meters. A PAN can be used to share data between a PC and a mobile devices and wearable technology devices, such as smart watches. It can also connect PCs and mobiles to peripheral devices, such as printers, headsets, speakers, and video displays. As digital and network functionality continues to be embedded in more and more everyday objects, appliances (the IOT), and clothing, the use of PANs will only grow.

## SANS
Most networks distinguish between two basic roles for the computers:

- A server computer is dedicated to running network applications and hosting shared resources.
- A client computer allows end users to access the applications and resources to do work.

On an enterprise LAN, server computers are hosted in a separate area, referred to as a "server room." A company with high server requirements might operate a datacenter, however. A datacenter is a whole site that is dedicated to provisioning server resources. Most datacenters are housed in purpose-built facilities. A datacenter has dedicated networking, power, climate control, and physical access control features all designed to provide a highly available environment for running critical applications.

Within an enterprise LAN or datacenter, a **storage area network (SAN)** provisions access to a configurable pool of storage devices that can be used by application servers. An SAN is isolated from the main network. It is only accessed by servers, not by client PCs and laptops. SAN clients are servers running databases or applications. Provisioning a shared storage pool as an SAN is more flexible and reliable than using local disks on each server machine. SANs use connectivity technologies such as Fiber Channel and Internet SCSI (iSCSI).
