#  2.6.1 DNS Record Types
----
The DNS server IP addresses configured on a client machine are used to resolve the client’s queries for hosts and domains across the Internet. At least one DNS server also needs to be configured to act as an authoritative store of information about each domain. These name servers are normally installed separately to the ones used as client resolvers.

The DNS server responsible for managing a zone will contain numerous resource records. These records allow the name server to resolve queries for names and services hosted in the domain into IP addresses. Resource records can be created and updated manually (statically), or they can be generated dynamically from information received from client and server computers on the network.

## 2.6.1.1.1/2 Address (A) and Address (AAAA) Resource Records

An **address (A)** record is used to resolve a host name to an IPv4 address. An **AAAA** record resolves a host name to an IPv6 address.

## 2.6.1.1.2 Mail Exchanger (MX) Resource Records

A **Mail Exchange (MX)** record is used to identify an email server for the domain so that other servers can send messages to it. In a typical network, multiple servers are installed to provide redundancy, and each one will be represented by an MX record. Each MX record is given a preference value, with the lowest numbered entry preferred. The host name identified in an MX record must have an associated A or AAAA record.

## 2.6.1.3/.1 SPAM Management Records
A **TXT** record is used to store any free-form text that may be needed to support other network services. A single domain name may have many TXT records, but they are most commonly used to verify email services and block the transmission of spoofed and unwanted messages, referred to as spam.

## 2.6.1.3.1.2 Sender Policy Framework

**Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** uses a TXT resource record published via DNS by an organization hosting email service. The SPF record—there must be only one per domain—identifies the hosts authorized to send email from that domain. An SPF can also indicate what to do with mail from servers not on the list, such as rejecting them (-all), flagging them (~all), or accepting them (+all). 

## 2.6.1.3.1.3DomainKeys Identified Mail

**DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)** uses cryptography to validate the source server for a given email message. This can replace or supplement SPF. To configure DKIM, the organization uploads a public encryption key as a TXT record in the DNS server. Organizations receiving messages can use this key to verify that a message derives from an authentic server.

## 2.6.1.3.1.3 Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance

The **Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)** framework ensures that SPF and DKIM are being utilized effectively. A DMARC policy is published as a DNS TXT record. DMARC can use SPF or DKIM or both. DMARC specifies a more robust policy mechanism for senders to specify how DMARC authentication failures should be treated (flag, quarantine, or reject), plus mechanisms for recipients to report DMARC authentication failures to the sender.
# 2.6.2 DHCP
----
## 2.6.2.1 DHCP Leases
----
A host is configured to use DHCP by specifying in its TCP/IP configuration that it should automatically obtain an IP address. When a DHCP client initializes, it broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet to find a DHCP server. All communications are sent using UDP, with the server listening on port 67 and the client on port 68.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230917203039.png)

*The DHCP client communicates with the server using broadcast communications so there is no need to configure a DHCP server address in the client configuration. The DHCP server must be configured with a static IP address.*

Presuming it has an IP address available, the DHCP server responds to the client with a DHCPOFFER packet, containing the address and other configuration information, such as default gateway and DNS server addresses. The client may choose to accept the offer using a DHCPREQUEST packet that is also broadcast onto the network. Assuming the offer is still available, the server will respond with a DHCPACK packet. The client broadcasts an ARP message to check that the address is unused. If so, it will start to use the address and options; if not, it declines the address and requests a new one. The IP address is leased by the server for a limited period only. A client can attempt to renew or rebind the lease before it expires. If the lease cannot be renewed, the client must release the IP address and start the discovery process again.

## 2.6.2.2DHCP Reservations
----
It is often useful for a host to use the same IP address. Servers, routers, printers, and other network infrastructure can be easier to manage if their IP addresses are known. One option is to use static addressing for these appliances, but this is difficult to implement. Another option is to configure the DHCP server to reserve a particular IP address for each device. The DHCP server is configured with a list of the MAC addresses of hosts that should receive the same IP address. When it is contacted by a host with one of the listed MAC addresses, it issues a lease for the reserved IP address.
## 2.6.2.3 DHCP Scope
----
A **scope** is the range of addresses that a DHCP server can offer to client hosts in a particular subnet. The scope should exclude any addresses that have been configured statically. For example, the LAN address of a SOHO router is typically 192.168.0.1. This is also the address used by the DHCP server running on the router. The scope must exclude this address. If the scope is defined as 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.199, that allows for 100 dynamically addressed hosts on the local network.


# 2.6.3 Virtual LAN
----
All hosts connected to the same unmanaged switch are said to be in the same broadcast domain. This does not present any problem on a small network. However, the switching fabric on an enterprise network can provide thousands of ports. Placing hundreds or thousands of hosts in the same broadcast domain reduces performance. To mitigate this, the ports can be divided into groups using a feature of managed switches called **virtual LAN (VLAN)**.

The simplest means of assigning a node to a VLAN is by configuring the port interface on the switch with a VLAN ID in the range 2 to 4094. For example, switch ports 1 through 10 could be configured as a VLAN with the ID 10, and ports 11 through 20 could be assigned to VLAN 20. Host A connected to port 2 would be in VLAN 10, and host B connected to port 12 would be in VLAN 20.

*The VLAN with ID 1 is referred to as the "default VLAN." Unless configured differently, all ports on a managed switch default to being in VLAN 1.*

When hosts are placed in separate VLANs, they can no longer communicate with one another directly, even though they might be connected to the same switch. Each VLAN must be configured with its own subnet address and IP address range. Communications between VLANs must go through an IP router. Each VLAN must also be provisioned with its own DHCP and DNS services.

As well as reducing the impact of excessive broadcast traffic, from a security point of view, each VLAN can represent a separate zone. Traffic passing between VLANs can easily be filtered and monitored to ensure it meets security policies. VLANs are also used to separate nodes based on traffic type, such as isolating devices used for VoIP so that they can more easily be prioritized over data passing over other VLANs.

# 2.6.4 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
----

A **virtual private network (VPN)** enables hosts to connect to the LAN without being physically installed at the site. Rather than attach to a switch or AP, the host connects to the local network via a remote access server that accepts connections from the Internet. Because the Internet is a public network, it is important for the VPN connection to be secure.

A secure VPN configures a protected tunnel through the Internet. It uses special connection protocols and encryption technology to ensure that the tunnel is protected against snooping and that the user is properly authenticated. Once the connection has been established, to all intents and purposes, the remote computer becomes part of the local network, though it is still restricted by the bandwidth available over the Internet connection.

*The VPN described above is for remote access to the LAN by teleworkers and roaming users. VPNs can also be used to connect sites over public networks, such as linking branch offices to a head office, or within a local network as an additional security mechanism.*
