# 2.4.1 Server Roles
----
Servers are one of the key components for any network. The server is a computer with a special operating system that can provide different roles on the network. Depending on the needs of the network, a single server can handle multiple roles or one specific role.

## Server Roles
----
### DNS
----
IP uses a binary address value to locate a host on an internetwork. The dotted decimal (IPv4) or hex (IPv6) representation of this IP address is used for configuration purposes, but it is not easy for people to remember or input correctly. For this reason, a "friendly" host name is also typically assigned to each host. The host name is configured when the OS is installed. The host name must be unique on the local network.

To avoid the possibility of duplicate host names on the Internet, the host name can be combined with a domain name and suffix. This is referred to as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). An example of an FQDN might be nut.widget.example. The host name is nut, and the domain suffix is widget.example. This domain suffix consists of the domain name widget within the top-level domain (TLD) .example. A domain suffix could also contain subdomains between the host and domain name.

FQDNs are assigned and managed using DNS. DNS is a global hierarchy of distributed name server databases that contain information about each domain and the hosts within those domains. At the top of the DNS hierarchy is the root, which is represented by the null label, consisting of just a period (.). There are 13 root-level servers (A to M).

Immediately below the root lie the top-level domains (TLDs). There are several types of TLDs, but the most prevalent are generic (such as .com, .org, .net, .info, .biz), sponsored (such as .gov, .edu), and country code (such as .uk, .ca, .de). DNS is operated by ICANN (icann.org), which also manages the generic TLDs. Country codes are generally managed by an organization appointed by the relevant government.

Each FQDN reflects this hierarchy, from most specific on the left (the host name) to least specific on the right (the TLD followed by the root). For example: pc.corp.515support.com.

#### DNS Queries
----
To resolve a host name or FQDN to an IP address, the client must obtain the appropriate record from a DNS server. For example, a user might type an FQDN into the address bar of a web browser client application. The client app, referred to as a "stub resolver," checks its local cache for the mapping. If no mapping is found, it forwards the query to its local DNS server. The IP addresses of one or more DNS servers that can act as resolvers are usually set in the TCP/IP configuration. The client communicates with a DNS server over **port 53**.

**optional**
The resolution process then takes place as follows:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917145536.png)

### DNS Record Types
----
The DNS server IP addresses configured on a client machine are used to resolve the client’s queries for hosts and domains across the Internet. At least one DNS server also needs to be configured to act as an authoritative store of information about each domain. These name servers are normally installed separately to the ones used as client resolvers.

The DNS server responsible for managing a zone will contain numerous resource records. These records allow the name server to resolve queries for names and services hosted in the domain into IP addresses. Resource records can be created and updated manually (statically), or they can be generated dynamically from information received from client and server computers on the network.
### DCHP
----
When an interface is assigned a static configuration manually, the installer may make a mistake with the address information—perhaps duplicating an existing IP address or entering the wrong subnet mask—or the configuration of the network may change, requiring the host to be manually configured with a new static address. To avoid these problems, a **DHCP** server can be used to allocate an appropriate IP address and subnet mask (plus other settings) to any host that connects to the network and requests address information.

### Print Servers & Fileshare
----
One of the core network functions is to provide shared access to disk and print resources. Like many network protocols, resource sharing is implemented using a client/server architecture. The machine hosting the disk or printer is the **server**. A server disk configured to allow clients to access it over the network is a **fileshare**. Machines accessing those resources are the clients.

The fileshare and print server roles may be implemented on a local network using proprietary protocols, such as File and Print Services for Windows Networks. A file server could also be implemented using TCP/IP protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

#### Server Message Block
----
**Server Message Block (SMB)** is the application protocol underpinning file and printer sharing on Windows networks. SMB usually runs directly over the TCP/445 port.

SMB has gone through several updates, with SMB3 as the current version. SMB1 has very serious security vulnerabilities and is now disabled by default on current Windows versions ([docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/detect-enable-and-disable-smbv1-v2-v3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/detect-enable-and-disable-smbv1-v2-v3)).

*Support for SMB in UNIX- or Linux-based machines and network attached storage (NAS) appliances is provided by using the Samba software suite ([samba.org/samba/what_is_samba.html](https://www.samba.org/samba/what_is_samba.html)), which allows a Windows client to access a Linux host as though it were a Windows file or print server.*

*SMB is sometimes referred to as the **Common Internet File System (CIFS)**, though technically that should only be used to refer to a specific dialect of SMB version 1.*

#### Network Basic Input/Output System

The earliest Windows networks used a protocol stack called the **Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS)** rather than TCP/IP. NetBIOS allowed computers to address one another by name and establish sessions for other protocols, such as SMB. As the TCP/IP suite became the standard for local networks, NetBIOS was re-engineered to work over the TCP and UDP protocols, referred to as NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT). NetBT uses UDP/137 for name services and TCP/139 for session services.

Modern networks use IP, TCP/UDP, and DNS for these functions, so NetBT is obsolete. NetBT should be disabled on most networks, as it poses a significant risk to security. It is only required if the network must support file sharing for Windows versions earlier than Windows 2000.

#### File Transfer Protocol

The **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** allows a client to upload and download files from a network server. It is often used to upload files to websites. FTP is associated with the use of port TCP/21 to establish a connection and either port TCP/20 to transfer data in "active" mode or a server-assigned port in "passive" mode.

*Plain FTP is unencrypted and so poses a high security risk. Passwords for sites are submitted in plaintext. There are ways of encrypting FTP sessions, such as FTP-Secure (FTPS) and FTP over Secure Shell (SFTP), and it is the encrypted services that are most widely used now.*


### Mail Server
----
Two types of **mail servers** and protocols are used to process email: mail transfer and mailbox access protocols:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917214512.png)

Internet email addresses follow the mailto URL scheme. An Internet email address comprises two parts—the username (local part) and the domain name, separated by an @ symbol. The domain name may refer to a company or an ISP; for example, phillip.choi@scf.com or phillip.choi@spectrum.com.

The **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** specifies how email is delivered from one mail domain to another. The SMTP server of the sender discovers the IP address of the recipient SMTP server by using the domain name part of the recipient's email address. The SMTP servers for the domain are registered in DNS using Mail Exchange (MX) and host (A/AAAA) records.

Typical SMTP configurations use the following ports and secure services:

- **Port TCP/25** is used for message relay between SMTP servers, or message transfer agents (MTAs). Transmissions over port 25 are usually unsecure.
- **Port TCP/587** is used by mail clients—message submission agents (MSAs)—to submit messages for delivery by an SMTP server. Servers configured to support port 587 should use encryption and authentication to protect the service.
##### MailBox Servers
----

SMTP is used only to deliver mail to server hosts that are permanently available. When an email is received by an SMTP server, it delivers the message to a mailbox server. The mailbox server could be a separate machine or a separate process running on the same computer. A mailbox access protocol allows the user's client email software to retrieve messages from the mailbox.

#### Post Office Protocol 3

The Post Office Protocol (POP) is an early example of a mailbox access protocol. POP is often referred to as POP3 because the active version of the protocol is version 3. A POP client application, such as Microsoft Outlook® or Mozilla Thunderbird®, establishes a connection to the POP server on port TCP/110 or over the secure port TCP/995. The user is authenticated (by username and password), and the contents of the mailbox are downloaded for processing on the local PC. With POP3, the messages are typically deleted from the mailbox server when they are downloaded, though some clients have the option to leave messages on the server.

#### Internet Message Access Protocol

The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) addresses some of the limitations of POP. IMAP is a mail retrieval protocol, but its mailbox management features lack POP. IMAP supports permanent connections to a server and connecting multiple clients to the same mailbox simultaneously. It also allows a client to manage the mailbox on the server (to organize messages in folders and to control when they are deleted, for instance) and to create multiple mailboxes.

A client connects to an IMAP server over port TCP/143, but this port is unsecure. Connection security can be established using TLS. The default port for IMAP-Secure (IMAPS) is TCP/993.
### Web Servers
----
A **web server** is one that provides client access using HTTP or its secure version (HTTPS). Websites and web applications are perhaps the most useful and ubiquitous of network services. Web technology can be deployed for a huge range of functions and applications, in no way limited to the static pages of information that characterized the first websites.

#### HyperText Transfer Protocol

HTTP enables clients (typically web browsers) to request resources from an HTTP server. A client connects to the HTTP server using port **TCP/80** (by default) and submits a request for a resource (GET). The server either returns the data requested data if it is available or responds with an error code.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917220940.png)

#### HyperText Markup Language, Forms, and Web Applications

HTTP is usually used to serve HTML web pages, which are plain text files with coded tags describing how the document should be formatted. A web browser can interpret the tags and display the text and other resources associated with the page (such as picture or sound files). Another powerful feature is the ability to provide hyperlinks to other related documents. HTTP also features forms mechanisms (POST) whereby a user can submit data from the client to the server.

The functionality of HTTP servers is often extended by support for scripting and programmable features (web applications).

#### Uniform Resource Locators

Resources on the Internet are accessed using an addressing scheme known as a uniform resource locator (URL). A URL contains all the information necessary to identify and access an item. For example, a URL for an HTTP resource might contain the following elements:

- The protocol describes the access method or service type being used.
- The host location is usually represented by a FQDN. The FQDN is not case sensitive. The host location can also be an IP address; an IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets.
- The file path specifies the directory and file name location of the resource (if required). The file path may or may not be case sensitive, depending on how the server is configured.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917221105.png)
####  Web Server Deployment

Typically, an organization will lease a web server or space on a server from an ISP. Larger organizations with Internet-connected datacenters may host websites themselves. Web servers are not only used on the public Internet, however. Private networks using web technologies are described as "intranets" (if they permit only local access) or "extranets" (if they permit remote access).

### AAA
---- 
Network clients can join the network using multiple types of access device, including switches, access points, and remote access VPN servers. Storing copies of the network directory and authentication information on all these access devices would require each device to do more processing and have more storage. It also increases the risk that this confidential information could be compromised.

An authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server is one that consolidates authentication services across multiple access devices.


#  2.4.2 Internet Appliances
----
## Spam Gateways & Unified Threat Management
----
Networks connected to the Internet need to be protected against malicious threats by various types of security scanner. These services can be implemented as software running on PC servers, but enterprise networks are more likely to use purpose-built Internet security appliances. The range of security functions performed by these appliances includes the following:

- Firewalls allow or block traffic based on a network access control list specifying source and destination IP addresses and application ports.
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are programmed with scripts that can identify known malicious traffic patterns. An IDS can raise an alert when a match is made. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) can additionally take some action to block the source of the malicious packets.
- Antivirus/antimalware solutions scan files being transferred over the network to detect any matches for known malware signatures in binary data.
- Spam gateways use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to verify the authenticity of mail servers and are configured with filters that can identify spoofed, misleading, malicious, or otherwise unwanted messages. The spam gateway is installed as a network server to filter out these messages before it is delivered to the user’s inbox.
- Content filters are used to block outgoing access to unauthorized websites and services.
- Data leak/loss prevention (DLP) systems scan outgoing traffic for information that is marked as confidential or personal. The DLP system can verify whether the transfer is authorized and block it if it is not.

These security functions could be deployed as separate appliances or server applications, each with its own configuration and logging/reporting system. A **unified threat management (UTM)** appliance is one that enforces a variety of security policies and controls, combining the work of multiple security functions. A UTM centralizes the threat management service, providing simpler configuration and reporting compared to isolated applications spread across several 
servers or devices.
## Load Balancers
----
A **load balancer** can be deployed to distribute client requests across server nodes in a farm or pool. You can use a load balancer in any situation where you have multiple servers providing the same function. Examples include web servers, email servers, web conferencing servers, and streaming media servers. The load balancer is placed in front of the server network and distributes requests from the client network or Internet to the application servers. The service address is advertised to clients as a virtual server. This is used to provision high availability services that can scale from light to heavy loads.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230918084001.png)

## Proxy servers
----
On a SOHO network, devices on the LAN access the Internet via the router using a type of NAT, specifically port-based or overloaded NAT. This type of NAT device translates between the private IP addresses used on the LAN and the publicly addressable IP address configured on the router’s WAN interface.

Many enterprise networks also use some sort of NAT, but another option is to deploy a **proxy server**. A proxy server does not just translate IP addresses. It takes a whole HTTP request from a client, checks it, then forwards it to the destination server on the Internet. When the reply comes back, it checks it and then shuttles it back to the LAN computer. A proxy can be used for other types of traffic too (email, for instance).
![](Pasted%20image%2020230918084051.png)

A proxy server can usually operate either as a transparent service, in which case, the client requires no special configuration, or as nontransparent. For a nontransparent proxy, the client must be configured with the IP address and service port (often 8080 by convention) of the proxy server.

A proxy can perform a security function by acting as a content filter to block access to sites deemed inappropriate. It can also apply rules to access requests, such as restricting overall time limits or imposing time-of-day restrictions. As well as managing and filtering outgoing access requests, a proxy can be configured to cache content to improve performance and reduce bandwidth consumption.

# 2.4.3 Legacy/embedded Systems
## Legacy
----
A **legacy system** is one that is no longer directly supported by its vendor. This might be because the vendor has gone out of business or formally deprecated use of the product. A product that is no longer supported is referred to as end of life (EOL). Networks often need to retain hosts running legacy OSs and applications software or old-style mainframe computers to run services that are too complex or expensive to migrate to a more modern platform.

Legacy systems usually work well for what they do—which is why they don't get prioritized for replacement—but they represent severe risks in terms of security vulnerabilities. If attackers discover faulty code that they can use to try to exploit the device, the vendor will not be available to develop a software patch to block the exploit. It is important to isolate them as far as possible from the rest of the network and to ensure that any network channels linking them are carefully protected and monitored.
## Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
----
An **embedded system** is an electronic device that is designed to perform a specific, dedicated function. These systems can be as small and simple as a microcontroller in an intravenous drip-rate meter or as large and complex as an industrial control system managing a water treatment plant. Embedded systems might typically have been designed to operate within a closed network, where the elements of the network are all known to the system vendor and there is no connectivity to wider computer data networks. Where embedded systems need to interact within a computer data network, there are special considerations to make in terms of the network design and support, especially regarding security.

#### Workflow and Process Automation Systems

An industrial control system (ICS) provides mechanisms for workflow and process automation. An ICS controls machinery used in critical infrastructure, such as power suppliers, water suppliers, health services, telecommunications, and national security services.

An ICS comprises plant devices and equipment with embedded programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The PLCs are linked by a cabled network to actuators that operate valves, motors, circuit breakers, and other mechanical components, plus sensors that monitor some local state, such as temperature. An embedded system network is usually referred to as an operational technology (OT) network to distinguish it from an IT network. Output and configuration of a PLC is performed by a human–machine interface (HMI). An HMI might be a local control panel or software running on a computing host. PLCs are connected within a control loop, and the whole process automation system can be governed by a control server. Another important concept is the data historian, which is a database of all the information generated by the control loop.

#### Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

A **supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)** system takes the place of a control server in large-scale, multiple-site ICSs. SCADAs typically run as software on ordinary computers, gathering data from and managing plant devices and equipment with embedded PLCs, referred to as "field devices." These embedded systems typically use WAN communications, such as cellular or satellite, to link the SCADA server to field devices.

*Both legacy and embedded systems represent a risk in terms of maintenance and troubleshooting as well as security, because they tend to require more specialized knowledge than modern, off-the-shelf, computing systems. Consultants with expertise in such systems can become highly sought after.*
# 2.4.4 Internet of Things (IOT) devices
----
The term **Internet of Things (IoT)** is used to describe the global network of wearable technology, home appliances, home control systems, vehicles, and other items that have been equipped with sensors, software, and network connectivity. These features allow these types of objects to communicate and pass data between themselves and other traditional systems, such as computer servers. Smart devices are used to implement home automation systems. An IoT smart device network will generally use the following types of components:

- **Hub/control system**—IoT devices usually require a communications hub to facilitate wireless networking. There must also be a control system, as many IoT devices are headless, meaning they cannot be operated directly using input and output devices. A hub could be implemented as a smart speaker operated by voice control or use a smartphone/PC app for configuration.
- **Smart devices**—IoT endpoints implement the function, such as a smart lightbulb, refrigerator, thermostat/heating control, or doorbell/video entry phone that you can operate and monitor remotely. These devices are capable of compute, storage, and network functions that are all potentially vulnerable to malicious code. Most smart devices use a Linux or Android kernel. Because they're effectively running mini-computers, smart devices are vulnerable to some of the standard attacks associated with web applications and network functions. Integrated peripherals, such as cameras or microphones, could be compromised to facilitate surveillance.

While the control system is typically joined to the Wi-Fi network, smart devices may use other wireless technologies, such as Z-Wave or Zigbee, to exchange data via the hub. These protocols are designed for operation on low-power devices without substantial CPU or storage resource.

**Application Areas (4 main system)**
IoT technology is comprised of four main systems that work together to support communication between two endpoints. These systems are the device itself, the gateway system, data storage systems that use cloud technology, and remote controls supported by mobile apps.

**Sensor**
One of the key features of IOT devices are built-in sensors that gather data. These sensors can include GPS, temperature reading, and heart rate monitoring. The sensors in the device collect data and then send it to the cloud.

**Storage**
To get the data to the cloud, the device must communicate through a gateway. The gateway acts as the bridge between the device and the cloud.

**Processing Data**
Once the data reaches the cloud, it's processed and analyzed by software. This is when the temperature reading is checked, trespassers are detected by the security camera, your location is determined before the GPS is updated, and so on. After the data is received and processed, the results are sent to device's application server and interface.

This is when the user has a chance to interact with the device. App notifications, emails, and texts deliver the information the device gathers to the user. For example, a notification or alert could let the user know that the front door was unlocked and opened. You can also interact with an IoT device through an interface such as an app that allows the user to check on the system without being prompted by the device. A user may check the video feed data in another room in the house through a phone app.  

Users are also able to give commands to IoT devices through their phones. They might notice the house is cold and command to the device to bring the temperature up before they get home. In most cases, IoT devices can perform certain actions automatically. For example, instead of just notifying the user of a break-in, the IoT system could automatically notify the authorities and sound an alarm.
