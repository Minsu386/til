 **Optional Ask about binary **
 1-10 = base 10
 binary = base 2
 Hex = base 16
 The values 0 and 1 also may be inferred as logical values, like yes/no or true/false, or activation states, such as on/off.

The two values can represent two stable states, such as:

- Voltage/Current: Two distinct levels allowed by a circuit
- Electrical Position: Two positions in which On=1 and Off=0
- Flip-Flop: Used to store information that continually changes between 0 and 1


The core protocol in TCP/IP is the **Internet Protocol (IP)**, which provides network and host **addressing** and packet forwarding between networks. An IP packet adds some headers to whatever transport/application layer data it is carrying in its payload. Two of the most important header fields are the source and destination IP address fields.There are two versions of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 address is 32 bits long. In its raw form it appears as11000000101010000000000000000001. The 32 bits can be arranged into four groups of eight bits (one byte) known as "octets." The above IP address could therefore be rearranged as11000000  10101000  00000000  00000001. This representation of an IP address is difficult for a human to memorize or to enter correctly into configuration dialogs. To make IP addresses easier to use, they are used in dotted decimal notation. This notation requires each octet to be converted to a decimal value. The decimal numbers are separated using a period. Converting the previous number to this notation gives192.168.0.1

If all the bits in an octet are set to 1, the number obtained is 255 (the maximum possible value). Similarly, if all the bits are set to 0, the number obtained is 0 (the minimum possible value). Therefore, theoretically an IPv4 address may be any value between 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255. However, some addresses are not permitted or are reserved for special use.

### Prefixes
----

An IPv4 address provides two pieces of information encoded within the same value:

- The network number (network ID) is common to all hosts on the same IP network.
- The host number (host ID) identifies a host within a particular IP network.

These two components within a single IP address are distinguished by combining the address with a network prefix. A prefix is a 32-bit value with a given number of contiguous bits all set to 1. For example, a prefix with 24 bits is the following binary value:11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000This can be written in slash notation in the form /24. The prefix can also be expressed in dotted decimal as a subnet mask:255.255.255.0

![](Pasted%20image%2020230918145857.png)

*The name "subnet mask" comes about because a single IP network can be divided into multiple logical subnetworks (subnets) using this method.*

When combined with an IP address, the prefix masks the host ID portion to reveal the network ID portion. Where there is a binary 1 in the prefix, the corresponding binary digit in the IP address is part of the network ID.

*Slash notation is used to refer to network IDs, while the subnet mask is typically used in host configuration dialogs. For example, 192.168.0.0/24 refers to an IP network, while 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0 refers to a host address on that IP network.*

### Forwarding
----
When a host attempts to send a packet via IPv4, the protocol compares the source and destination IP address in the packet against the sending host’s subnet mask. If the masked portions of the source and destination IP addresses match, then the destination interface is assumed to be on the same IP network or subnet. For example:

![](Pasted%20image%2020230918150209.png)


In the example, the host will determine that the destination IPv4 address is on the same IP network (192.168.0.0/24) and try to deliver the packet locally. On Ethernet, the host would use the address resolution protocol (ARP) to identify the MAC address associated with the destination IP address.

If the masked portion does not match, the host assumes that the packet must be routed to another IP network. For example:

![](Pasted%20image%2020230918150235.png)


In this case, the source host 192.168.0.100 identifies that the destination IPv4 address is on a different IP network (192.168.1.0/24). Consequently, it forwards the packet to a router rather than trying to deliver it locally. Most hosts are configured with a default gateway parameter. The default gateway is the IP address of a router interface that the host can use to forward packets to other networks. The default gateway must be in the same IP network as the host.
 
## 2.5.1.1.1 Private / 2.5.1.1.2 Public Address
----
To communicate on the Internet, a host must be configured with a unique **public** IP address. Public addresses are allocated to customer networks by ISPs. Relatively few companies can obtain sufficient public IPv4 addresses for all their computers to communicate over the Internet, however. There are various mechanisms to work around the shortage of available public addresses.

### Private Address Ranges

The IPv4 address scheme defines certain ranges as reserved for **private** addressing, often called "RFC 1918" addresses after the document in which they were published. Hosts with IP addresses from these ranges are not allowed to route traffic over the public Internet. Use of the addresses is confined to private LANs. There are three private address ranges:

- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Class A private address range).
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Class B private address range).
- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Class C private address range).

### Address Classes and Default Subnet Masks

The address classes (A, B, and C) derive from the earliest form of IP. When first defined, IP did not include the concept of subnet masks. Hosts would identify the network ID just by using the address class. The subnet masks that align precisely with octet boundaries mirror this functionality. They are often referred to as the "default masks":

|Class|Dotted Decimal Mask|Network Prefix|Binary Mask|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|255.0.0.0|/8|11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000|
|B|255.255.0.0|/16|11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000|
|C|255.255.255.0|/24|11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000|

#### Internet Access Using Private Addressing

As a host configured with a private address cannot access the Internet directly, some mechanism must be used to allow it to forward packets. Internet access can be facilitated for hosts using a private addressing scheme in two ways: Through a router configured with a single or block of valid public addresses; the router uses network address translation (NAT) to convert between the private and public addresses. Through a proxy server that fulfills requests for Internet resources on behalf of clients.


## 2.5.1.2 IPv6
----
 IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space") to 4,294,967,296 (232)
 IPv6 - [3.4x10^38 - Wolfram|Alpha (wolframalpha.com)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.4x10%5E38)

The pool of available IPv4 public addresses is not very large, compared to the number of devices that need to connect to the Internet. While private addressing and NAT provides a workable solution, IP version 6 (IPv6) is intended to replace IPv4 completely, at some point. An **IPv6** address is a 128-bit number and so can express exponentially more address values that the 32-bit number used in IPv4.

### IPv6 Notation

IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal notation. One hex digit can represent a four-bit binary value (a nibble). To express a 128-bit IPv6 address in hex, the binary address is divided into eight double-byte (16-bit) values delimited by colons. For example:
2001:0db8:0000:0000:0abc:0000:def0:1234

### IPv6 Network Prefixes

An IPv6 address is divided into two main parts: the first 64 bits are used as a network ID, while the second 64 bits designate a specific interface.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230918152529.png)
*In IPv6, the interface identifier is always the last 64 bits; the first 64 bits are used for network addressing.*

As the network and host portions are fixed size, there is no need for a subnet mask. Network addresses are written using prefix notation, where /nn is the length of the routing prefix in bits. Within the 64-bit network ID, the length of any given network prefix is used to determine whether two addresses belong to the same IP network.

*For example, most ISPs receive allocations of /32 blocks and issue each customer with a /48 prefix for use on a private network. A /48 block allows the private network to be configured with up to 65,346 subnets.*

### Global and Link-Local Addressing

In IPv4, hosts generally have a single IP address per interface. IPv6 interfaces are more likely to be configured with multiple addresses. The main types are global and link-local:

- A global address is one that is unique on the Internet (equivalent to public addresses in IPv4). In hex notation, a global address starts with a 2 or with a 3.
- Link-local addresses are used on the local segment to communicate with neighbor hosts. In hex notation, link-local addresses start with fe80::

While it is possible to configure IPv6 addresses statically, most hosts obtain a global and link-local address via the local router. This process is referred to as StateLess Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC). IPv6 hosts do not need to be configured with a default gateway. IPv6 uses a protocol called Neighbor Discovery (ND). ND is used to implement SLAAC, allows a host to discover a router, and performs the interface address querying functions performed by ARP in IPv4.

### Dual Stack

While IPv6 is designed to replace IPv4, transitioning from IPv4 has proved enormously difficult. Consequently, most hosts and routers can operate both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time. This is referred to as "dual stack." Typically, a host will default to attempting to establish an IPv6 connection and fall back to IPv4 if the destination host does not support IPv6.




## 2.5.1.3 Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
----
## 2.5.1.4 Static
----
Using **static** addressing requires an administrator to visit each computer to manually enter the configuration information for that host. If the host is moved to a different IP network or subnet, the administrator must manually reconfigure it. The administrator must keep track of which IP addresses have been allocated to avoid issuing duplicates. In a large network, configuring IP statically on each node can be very time consuming and prone to errors that can potentially disrupt communication on the network.

Static addresses are typically only assigned to systems with a dedicated functionality, such as router interfaces or application servers that need to use a fixed IP address.

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

As an alternative to static configuration, a host can receive its IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses from a **dynamic** host configuration protocol (DHCP) server.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230918153927.png)

With DHCP, we configure a server with the IP configuration information. Then when a host wants to connect, it sends out a broadcast message to look for a DHCP server. If one exists, it responds with an IP address and other configuration settings. Using DHCP is great since it eliminates the need to manually configure every single host as they join a network. In fact, most wireless routers today even have DHCP functionality and can serve as the DHCP server in your home.

## 2.5.1.6 Gateway
----
 The default gateway is responsible for forwarding data packets to destinations outside of the local network. For example, if a host on your internal network sends a request for www.testout.com, that packet will be sent to the default gateway, who'll then forward it on to the TestOut web server. When the requested data comes back, the gateway sends it to the requesting host device. The default gateway is typically a router that sits on the edge of the network.
