## 802.11b/g and the 2.3GHz Band
----
The **IEEE 802.11b** standard uses the **2.4 GHz** frequency band and was released in parallel with 802.11a. The signal encoding methods used by 802.11b are inferior to 802.11a and support a nominal data rate of just 11 Mbps.

The 2.4 GHz band is subdivided into up to 14 channels, spaced at 5 MHz intervals from 2,412 MHz up to 2,484 MHz. Because the spacing is only 5 MHz and Wi-Fi needs 20 MHz channel bandwidth, 802.11b channels overlap quite considerably. This means that interference is a real possibility unless widely spaced channels are chosen (1, 6, and 11, for instance). Also, in the Americas, regulations permit the use of channels 1–11 only, while in Europe, channels 1–13 are permitted, and in Japan, all 14 channels are permitted.

The **IEEE 802.11g** standard offered a relatively straightforward upgrade path from 802.11b; uses the same encoding mechanism and 54 Mbps rate as 802.11a but in the 2.4 GHz band used by 802.11b and with the same channel layout. This made it straightforward for vendors to design 802.11g devices that could offer backwards support for legacy 802.11b clients.

## 802.11A and the 5GHz Frequency Band
----
The **IEEE 802.11a** standard uses the 5 GHz frequency band only. The data encoding method allows a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps. The 5 GHz band is subdivided into 23 non-overlapping channels, each of which is 20 MHz wide.

The exact use of channels can be subject to different regulation in different countries. **Regulatory impacts** also include a limit on power output, constraining the range of Wi-Fi devices. Devices operating in the 5 GHz band must implement [dynamic frequency selection (DFS)](dynamic%20frequency%20selection%20(DFS).md) to prevent Wi-Fi signals from interfering with nearby radar and satellite installations.

### BlueTooth
Bluetooth is used to connect peripheral devices to PCs and mobiles and to share data between two systems. Many portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets, wearable tech, audio speakers, and headphones, now use Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth uses radio communications and supports speeds of up to 3 Mbps. Adapters supporting version 3 or 4 of the standard can achieve faster rates (up to 24 Mbps) through the ability to negotiate an 802.11 radio link for large file transfers.

Also uses 2.4GHz range, but part of the unlicensed (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) ISM Band 

The earliest Bluetooth version supports a maximum range of 10 m (30 feet), while newer versions support a range of over 100 feet, though signal strength will be weak at this distance. Bluetooth devices can use a pairing procedure to authenticate and exchange data securely.

Version 4 introduced a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) variant of the standard. BLE is designed for small battery-powered devices that transmit small amounts of data infrequently. A BLE device remains in a low power state until a monitor application initiates a connection. BLE is not backwards compatible with "classic" Bluetooth, though a device can support both standards simultaneously.

### NFC
Near Field Communications (NFC) is a peer-to-peer version of RFID; that is, an NFC device can work as both tag and reader to exchange information with other NFC devices. NFC normally works at up to two inches (6 cm) at data rates of 106, 212, and 424 Kbps. NFC sensors and functionality are starting to be incorporated into smartphones. NFC is mostly used for contactless payment readers, security ID tags, and shop shelf-edge labels for stock control. It can also be used to configure other types of connection, such as pairing Bluetooth devices.

### RFID
Radio Frequency ID (RFID) is a means of identifying and tracking objects using specially encoded tags. When an RFID reader scans a tag, the tag responds with the information programmed into it. A tag can be either an unpowered, passive device that only responds when scanned at close range (up to about 25 m) or a powered, active device with a range of 100 m. Passive RFID tags can be embedded in stickers and labels to track parcels and equipment. RFID is also used to implement some types of access badge to operate electronic locks.

# 2.3.5 Long Range Fixed wireless
----
Wireless technology can be used to configure a bridge between two networks. This can be a more cost-effective and practical solution than laying cable. However, regulation of the radio spectrum means that the transmitters required to cover long distances must be carefully configured. These solutions are referred to as long-range fixed wireless.

Point-to-point line of sight fixed wireless uses ground-based high-gain microwave antennas that must be precisely aligned with one another. "High-gain" means that the antenna is strongly directional. Each antenna is pointed directly at the other and can transmit signals at ranges of up to about 30 miles as long as they are unobstructed by physical objects. The antennas themselves are typically affixed to the top of tall buildings or mounted on tall poles to reduce the risk from obstructions.

Long-range fixed wireless can be implemented using licensed or unlicensed frequency spectrum. Licensed means that the network operator purchases the exclusive right to use a frequency band within a given geographical area from the regulator. The US regulator is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). If any interference sources are discovered, the network operator has the legal right to get them shut down.

Unlicensed spectrum means the operator uses a public frequency band, such as 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz. Anyone can use these frequencies, meaning that interference is a risk. To minimize the potential for conflicts, power output is limited by regulatory requirements. A wireless signal’s power has three main components:

- Transmit power is the basic strength of the radio, measured in dBm.
- Antenna gain is the amount that a signal is boosted by directionality—focusing the signal in a single direction rather than spreading it over a wide area. Gain is measured in decibels isotropic (dBi).
- Effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is the sum of transmit power and gain, expressed in dBm.

Lower frequencies that propagate farther have stricter power limits than higher frequencies. However, higher EIRPs are typically allowed for highly directional antennas. For example, in the 2.4 GHz band, each 3 dBi increase in gain can be compensated for by just a 1 dBm reduction in transmit power. This allows point-to-point wireless antennas to work over longer ranges than Wi-Fi APs.
