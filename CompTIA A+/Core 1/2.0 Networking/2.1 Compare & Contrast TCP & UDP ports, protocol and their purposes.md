# 2.1.1.1 FTP
----
**The goals of FTP are:** 

- It encourages the direct use of remote computers.
- It shields users from system variations (operating system, directory structures,  file structures, etc.)
- It promotes sharing of files and other types of data.

**FTP Clients**
FTP works on a client-server model. The FTP client is a program that runs on the user’s computer to enable the user to talk to and get files from remote computers. It is a set of commands that establishes the connection between two hosts, helps to transfer the files, and then closes the connection.

- FTP client contacts FTP server at port 21 specifying TCP as transport protocol.
- Client obtain authorization over control connection.
- Client browse remote directory by sending commands over control connection.
- When server receives a command for a file transfer, the server open a TCP data connection to client.
- after transferring one file, server closes connection.
- server opens a second TCP data connection to transfer another file.
- FTP server maintains state i.e. current directory, earlier authentication.

# 2.1.1.2 SSH
----
**Secure Shell (SSH)** is also a remote access protocol, but it connects to a command interpreter rather than a desktop window manager. SSH uses TCP port 22 (by default). SSH uses encryption to protect each session. There are numerous commercial and open-source SSH products available for all the major OS platforms.

Each SSH server is configured with a public/private encryption key pair, identified by a host key fingerprint. Clients use the host key fingerprint to verify that they are attempting to connect to a trusted server and mitigate the risk of on-path attacks. A mapping of host names to SSH server keys can be kept manually by each SSH client, or there are various enterprise software products designed for SSH key management.

The server's host key pair is used to set up an encrypted channel so that the client can submit authentication credentials securely. SSH allows various methods for the client to authenticate to the server. Each of these methods can be enabled or disabled as required on the server. Two commonly implemented methods are as follows:

Password authentication—The client submits a username and password that are verified by the SSH server either against a local user database or using an authentication server.
Public key authentication—The server is configured with a list of the public keys of authorized user accounts. The client requests authentication using one of these keys, and the server generates a challenge with the user’s public key. The client must use the matching private key it holds to decrypt the challenge and complete the authentication process. 

**Monitoring for and removing compromised client public keys is a critical security task. Many recent attacks on web servers have exploited poor SSH key management.**

Secure Shell (SSH) is the principal means of obtaining secure remote access to UNIX and Linux servers and to most types of network appliances (switches, routers, and firewalls). As well as encrypted terminal emulation, SSH can be used for SFTP and to achieve many other network configurations. Numerous commercial and open-source  SSH servers and terminal emulation clients are available for all the major NOS platforms (UNIX®, Linux®, Windows®, and macOS®). The most widely used is OpenSSH (openssh.com). An SSH server listens on port TCP/22 by default.
# 2.1.1.3 Telnet
----

Port 23 Telnet is used to remotely connect to another system. Be aware that all data is transmitted in cleartext. Because of this, Telnet is not used often.|

# 2.1.1.4 SMTP
----
## **SMTP Fundamentals**

SMTP is an application layer protocol. The client who wants to send the mail opens a [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through **port 25.** After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.

## **SMTP Protocol**

The SMTP model is of two types:
1. End-to-end method
2. Store-and-forward method

The end-to-end model is used to communicate between different organizations whereas the store and forward method is used within an organization. An SMTP client who wants to send the mail will contact the destination’s host SMTP directly, in order to send the mail to the destination. The SMTP server will keep the mail to itself until it is successfully copied to the receiver’s SMTP. 

The client SMTP is the one that initiates the session so let us call it the client-SMTP and the server SMTP is the one that responds to the session request so let us call it receiver-SMTP. The client-SMTP will start the session and the receiver SMTP will respond to the request.
# 2.1.1.5 DNS
----
## How Does DNS Work?

The working of DNS starts with converting a hostname into an IP Address. A domain name serves as a distinctive identification for a website. It is used in place of an IP address to make it simpler for consumers to visit websites. Domain Name System works by executing the database whose work is to store the name of hosts which are available on the Internet. The top-level domain server stores address information for top-level domains such as .com and .net, .org, and so on. If the Client sends the request, then the DNS resolver sends a request to DNS Server to fetch the IP Address. In case, when it does not contain that particular IP Address with a hostname, it forwards the request to another DNS Server. When IP Address has arrived at the resolver, it completes the request over [Internet Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-protocols/).
![](Pasted%20image%2020230916093351.png)

## What is DNS Lookup?

DNS Lookup or DNS Resolution can be simply termed as the process that helps in allowing devices and applications that translate readable domain names to the corresponding IP Addresses used by the computers for communicating over the web.

## What is DNS Caching?

[DNS Caching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dns-spoofing-or-dns-cache-poisoning/) can be simply termed as the process used by DNS Resolvers for storing the previously resolved information of DNS that contains domain names, and IP Addresses for some time. The main principle of DNS Caching is to speed up the process of future DNS lookup and also help in reducing the overall time of DNS Resolution.
# 2.1.1.6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
----

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP, is used to assign network devices their IP configurations when they connect into a network. When a client connects, the DHCP request is sent on port 67 to the DHCP server. It sends the IP configuration back to the host using port 68.

## **Advantages of DHCP**

The advantages of using DHCP include: 

- Centralized management of IP addresses.
- Centralized and automated [TCP/IP configuration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/).
- Ease of adding new clients to a network.
- Reuse of IP addresses reduces the total number of IP addresses that are required.
- The efficient handling of IP address changes for clients that must be updated frequently, such as those for portable devices that move to different locations on a wireless network.
- Simple reconfiguration of the IP address space on the DHCP server without needing to reconfigure each client.
- The DHCP protocol gives the network administrator a method to configure the network from a centralized area. 
- With the help of DHCP, easy handling of new users and the reuse of IP addresses can be achieved.

## **Disadvantages of DHCP**

The disadvantage of using DHCP is: 

- IP conflict can occur.
- The problem with DHCP is that clients accept any server. Accordingly, when another server is in the vicinity, the client may connect with this server, and this server may possibly send invalid data to the client.
- The client is not able to access the network in absence of a DHCP Server.
- The name of the machine will not be changed in a case when a new IP Address is assigned.

# 2.1.1.7 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
----
**HTTP** stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. Tim Berner invents it. HyperText is the type of text which is specially coded with the help of some standard coding language called [HyperText Markup Language (HTML)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-introduction/). **HTTP/2** is the successor version of HTTP, which was published on May 2015. HTTP/3 is the latest version of HTTP, which is published in 2022.

The protocol used to transfer hypertext between two computers is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol.   
HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 

## Working of HTTP

First of all, whenever we want to open any website then first open a web browser after that we will type the URL of that website (e.g., www.facebook.com ). This URL is now sent to [Domain Name Server (DNS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-server-dns-in-application-layer/). Then DNS first check records for this URL in their database, then DNS will return the IP address to the web browser corresponding to this URL. Now the browser is able to send requests to the actual server. 

After the server sends data to the client, the connection will be closed. If we want something else from the server we should have to re-establish the connection between the client and the server.


# 2.1.1.8 Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
---- 
PORT 110
## What is POP?

POP stands for Post Office Protocol. The [POP protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pop-full-form/) was published in the year 1984. POP has been updated two times namely “POP2” and “POP3”. The POP protocol is an Internet Standard Protocol that works on the application layer. It is used to get an access email from the mail server. The need for POP mainly arises when the user or client does not have a continuous internet connection and what’s to receive email messages. The Pop client makes use of POP to pull email messages from the POP server. POP3 is the updated version of POP.

## What is POP3?

POP 3 stands for Post Office Protocol Version 3. POP3 protocol is used to provide access to the mail inbox that is stored in the email server. POP3 protocol can download and delete messages. Once the POP3 client has established a connection with the mail server it can easily retrieve all the messages from the server. The user can access the messages locally even if the user is offline. Every time the client needs to check manually for new messages as POP3 Protocol provides the feature of real-time synchronization. Various email applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, Gmail supports POP3 protocol.

![IMG-20230817-WA0019](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230817212918/IMG-20230817-WA0019.jpg)

### POP3 Ports

POP3 makes use of two network ports. They are:

- ****Port 110:**** Port 110 is a default TCP port used by POP3. But It has a disadvantage that it does not support encrypted communication.
- ****Port 995:**** Port 995 is majorly used for more secure applications. Port 995 is a [TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/) or [SSL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/) port used to provide more security.
## Working of POP3

- Initially, POP3 needs to establish a connection between the POP client and the POP server.
- Once a secure connection is established several commands are exchanged between them to perform the task.
- Once a connection is established client requests available email messages.
- The Server sends the available messages along with their size and unique identifier number.
- Once the client receives the message, it makes a request to the server for downloading the messages. The user marks such messages and sends them to the server.
- Upon receiving from the client-server sends the messages selected by the client and accordingly marks them as read or unread.
- The client if want sends a request for deleting the messages.
- Once the tasks are completed the client sends a close connection request to the server
- The server then sends an acknowledgment to the client and closes the connection.

## Advantages of POP3

- The message can be read offline also.
- POP3 requires less storage space.
- POP3 is easy to use and configure.
- POP3 is supported by many email applications.

## Disadvantages of POP3

- POP3 does not provide the feature of real-time synchronization.
- If an email consists of virus attachments it can affect the system easily.
- POP3 does not support accessing the same email at the same time on different systems.
- At a time entire email folder can be discarded.

# 2.1.1.9 NetBIOS / NetBT
----
NetBIOS is an acronym that stands for Network Basic Input Output System. It enables computer communication over a [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/) and the sharing of files and printers. [TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) network devices are identified using NetBIOS names (Windows). It must be network-unique and limited to 16 characters, with 15 reserved for the device name and the 16th reserved for identifying the type of service running or name record type.

[What Is NetBios? Understanding Network Protocols By WireX Systems](https://wirexsystems.com/resource/protocols/netbios/)

## NetBT
**NetBIOS over TCP/IP** (**NBT**, or sometimes **NetBT**) is a [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") that allows legacy computer applications relying on the [NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS "NetBIOS") [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API "API") to be used on modern [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite") [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network")

# 2.1.1.10 IMAP
----
PORT 143
**Features of IMAP :**

- It is capable of managing multiple mailboxes and organizing them into various categories.
- Provides adding of message flags to keep track of which messages are being seen.
- It is capable of deciding whether to retrieve email from a mail server before downloading.
- It makes it easy to download media when multiple files are attached.

**Working of IMAP :**  
IMAP follows Client-server Architecture and is the most commonly used email protocol. It is a combination of client and server process running on other computers that are connected through a network. This protocol resides over the TCP/IP protocol for communication. Once the communication is set up the server listens on port 143 by default which is non-encrypted. For the secure encrypted communication port, 993 is used.

**Architecture of IMAP :**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210115223946/imap.png)

**Advantages :**

- It offers synchronization across all the maintained sessions by the user.
- It provides security over POP3 protocol as the email only exists on the IMAP server.
- Users have remote access to all the contents.
- It offers easy migration between the devices as it is synchronized by a centralized server.
- There is no need to physically allocate any storage to save contents.

**Disadvantages :**

- IMAP is complex to maintain.
- Emails of the user are only available when there is an internet connection.
- It is slower to load messages.
- Some emails don’t support IMAP which makes it difficult to manage.
- Many browser-based solutions are unavailable due to not support of IMAP.
# 2.1.1.11 Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP)
port UDP 161

[SNMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/) (Simple Network Management Protocol) is an application layer protocol that utilizes the UDP protocol to manage routers, hubs, and switches on an IP network. SNMP is a widely used protocol that is enabled on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows Server, Linux servers, and network devices such as routers and switches.  
On a target system, SNMP enumeration is used to list user accounts, passwords, groups, system names, and devices.

### Component:

SNMP Enumeration is made up of three major parts:

1. **Managed Device:** A managed device is a device or a host (technically referred to as a node) that has the SNMP service enabled. These devices include routers, switches, hubs, bridges, computers, and so on.
2. **Agents:** An agent is a software component that runs on a managed device. Its primary function is to convert data into an SNMP-compatible format for network management via the SNMP protocol.
3. **Network Management System (NMS) :** NMS are software systems that are employed to monitor network devices.

### Working:

The process of enumerating user accounts and devices on a target machine using SNMP is known as SNMP enumeration. SNMP is made up of a manager and an agent; the agent is embedded in every network device, while the manager is installed on a separate computer. To access and configure the SNMP agent from the management station, SNMP stores two passwords:

- Read the community string: By default, it is public and allows viewing of device/system configuration.
- Read/write community string: It is private by default and allows remote configuration editing.

These default community strings are used by attackers to gather information about a machine. Attackers use SNMP to gather data on the network’s resources such as hosts, routers, devices, shares, and so on, as well as network information such as ARP tables, routing tables, traffic, and so on.

### The architecture of SNMP Enumeration:

![SNMP Enumeration](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220907123817/snmpenumeration.jpg)

1. **Management Agent:** An application that resides in managed devices such as hosts, bridges, routers, and so on. The agent responds to the operative’s requests for data and actions and may send asynchronous messages to the operative in the event of a critical event.
2. **Management Station:** It serves as the human network manager’s interface to the network management station (or network operation center NOC), from which he monitors and manages the network and assists in fault recovery.
3. **Network Management Protocol**: The network management protocol (SNMP) is used to transfer data and commands between agents and managing entities. For communication between managers and agents, SNMP employs the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the transport protocol. The reasons for exploitation of UDP for SNMP area unit are as follows:
    1. First, it has low overheads in comparison to the protocol, which uses a 3-way handshake for the association. 
    2. Second, in large networks, SNMP over protocol may be a risky strategy because the protocol to ensure dependability can flood the network with retransmissions. SNMP sends and receives requests on UDP port 161, and receives traps from managed devices on UDP port 162.
4. **Management database (MIB) :** A management database is represented as a collection of managed objects. These objects together form the MIB virtual database. Although an agent may implement multiple MIBs, all agents must implement a single MIB, known as MIB-II. This standard defines variables for things like interface statistics (interface speeds, MTU, octets sent, octets received, and so on) as well as various other things related to the system itself (system location, system contact, etc.). MIB-primary II’s goal is to generate general TCP/IP management data.

# 2.1.1.12 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
----
PORT 389
Network information such as usernames, passwords, computer accounts, group policies, and other user and device information are stored in a directory service such as Microsoft's Active Directory.  
  
LDAP is the protocol used to access this information across the network. LDAP is an open-source, vendor neutral protocol. It can work with other directory services, not just Microsoft’s Active Directory.

**Directories:**  
Directories are set of object with similar attributes, organised in a logical and hierarchical manner. For example, Telephonic Directories. It is a distributed database application used to manage attributes in a directory.

LDAP defines operations for accessing and modifying directory entries such as:

- Searching for user specified criteria
- Adding an entry
- Deleting an entry
- Modifying an entry
- Modifying the distinguished name or relative distinguished name of an entry
- Comparing an entry

**LDAP Models:**  
LDAP can be explained by using four models upon which it based:

1. **Information Model:**  
    This model describes structure of information stored in an LDAP Directory.In this basic information is stored in directory is called an entity. Entries here represents object of interest in real world such as people, server, organization, etc. Entries contain collection of attributes that contain information about object.Every attribute has a type and one or more values. Here types of attribute is associated with syntax and syntax specifies what kind of values can be stored
2. **Naming Model:**  
    This model describes how information in an LDAP Directory is organized and identified. In this entries are organized in a Tree-Like structure called Directory Information Tree (DIT). Entries are arranged within DIT based on their distinguished name DN. DN is a unique name that unambiguously identifies a single entry.
3. **Functional Model:**  
    LDAP defines operations for accessing and modifying directory entries . In this we discuss about LDAP operations in a programming language independent manner LDAP operations can be divided into following categories:
    
    • Query
    • Update 
    • Authentication 
    
4. **Security Model:**  
    This model describes how information in LDAP directory can be protected from unauthorized access. It is based on BIND operation. There are several bind operation can be performed.

# 2.1.1.15 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
----
PORT 3389

Telnet and SSH provide terminal emulation for command-line shells. This is sufficient for most admin task, but where users want to connect to a desktop, they usually prefer to work with a GUI. A GUI remote admin tool sends screen and audio data from the remote host to the client and transfers mouse and keyboard input from the client to the remote host. RDP is a Microsoft protocol for operating remote GUI connections to windows machine. It uses TCP/3389. The admin can specify permissions to connect to the server via RDP and can configure encryption on the connection. 

RDP clients are available for other OSs, including Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android so you can connect to a windows desktop remotely using a non-windows device. There are also open-source RDP server products such as xrdp. 

risks from allowing connections to RDP over the Internet as it allows malicious remote hosts to scan the port for vulnerabilities or to get access via a weak password. 

# 2.1.2 TCP vs UDP
----
## TCP
----
IP transmits a stream of application data as a series of packets. Any given packet could be damaged or fail to arrive due to faults or network congestion. TCP provides several mechanisms to overcome this lack of reliability. It is described as a "connection-oriented" protocol because it performs the following functions:

Establishes a connection between the sender and recipient using a handshake sequence of SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK packets.
Assigns each packet a sequence number so that it can be tracked.
Allows the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) that a packet has been received.
Allows the receiver to send a negative acknowledgement (NACK) to force retransmission of a missing or damaged packet.
Allows the graceful termination of a session using a FIN handshake.
The main drawback is that this connection information requires multiple header fields. Using TCP can add 20 bytes or more to the size of each packet.

TCP is used when the application protocol cannot tolerate missing or damaged information. For example, the following application protocols must use TCP:

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)—This protocol is used to deliver web pages and other resources. The secure version uses encryption to authenticate the server and protect the information that is being transmitted. A single missing packet would cause this process to fail completely.
Secure Shell (SSH)—This protocol is used to access the command-line interface of a computer from across the network. It uses encryption to authenticate the server and user and protect the information that is being transmitted. This process would also fail if a data packet is not received.


## UDP
----
Sometimes it is more important that communications be faster than they are reliable. The connection-oriented process of TCP adds lots of header bytes to each packet. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless, non-guaranteed method of communication with no sequencing or acknowledgements. There is no guarantee regarding the delivery of messages or the sequence in which packets are received. 

UDP is suitable for applications that do not require acknowledgement of receipt and can tolerate missing or out-of-order packets. It is often used by applications that transfer time-sensitive data but do not require complete reliability, such as voice or video, because missing data manifests as glitches rather than application errors or complete connection failures. The reduced overhead means that delivery is faster. If necessary, the application layer can be used to control delivery reliability.

Two other examples of protocols that use UDP are DHCP and TFTP:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)—This protocol is used by clients to request IP configuration information from a server. It uses broadcast transmissions, which are not supported by TCP, so it must use UDP. The protocol is quite simple, so if a response packet is not received, the client just restarts the process and tries again repeatedly, until timing out.
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)—This protocol is typically used by network devices to obtain a configuration file. The application protocol uses its own acknowledgement messaging, so it does not require TCP.
