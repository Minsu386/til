# 2.2.1 Routers
----
A router forwards packets around an internetwork using IP addresses. A MAC address only identifies a hardware port. AN IP Address contains the identity of both the network and a single host within that network

There are several types of routers and different uses for them. A Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) Router often simply routes between its local network interface and its WAN/Internet interface. An enterprise network is likely to use different router models to perform different routing tasks:

- A LAN Router divides a single physical network into multiple logical subnetworks. Each logical network becomes a separate broadcast domain. Having too many hosts in the same broadcast domain reduces performance. There is also a security benefit because traffic passing from one logical network to another can be subject to filtering rules. This type of router generally has only Ethernet interfaces
- A WAN or border router forwards traffic to and from the internet or over a private WAN link. This type of router has an Ethernet interface for the local network and a digital modem interface for the WAN


# 2.2.2 Switches
----
A solution to the issue of collisions was first provided by inserting Ethernet bridges between hubs to break up collision domains. Ethernet bridges were quickly refined into the Ethernet switch appliances that underpin almost all modern office networks. Like a hub, an Ethernet switch provisions one port for each device that needs to connect to the network. Unlike a hub, an Ethernet switch can decode each frame and identify the source and destination MAC addresses. It can track which MAC source addresses are associated with each port. When it receives an incoming frame, the switch intelligently forwards it to the port that is a match for the destination MAC address.

This means that each switch port is a separate collision domain, and the negative effects of contention are eliminated. Each computer has a full duplex connection to the network and can send and receive simultaneously at the full speed supported by the network cabling and NIC.

## Unmanaged
----
An unmanaged switch performs its function without requiring any sort of configuration. You just power it on and connect some hosts to it, and it establishes Ethernet connectivity between the network interfaces without any more intervention. You might find unmanaged switches with four or eight ports used in small networks. There is an unmanaged four-port switch embedded in most of the SOHO router/modems supplied by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to connect to their networks.

## Managed
----

Larger workgroups and corporate networks require additional functionality in their switches. Switches designed for larger LANs are managed switches. A managed switch will work as an unmanaged switch outofthebox, but an administrator can connect to it over a management port, configure security settings, and then choose options for the switch's more advanced functionality. Most managed switches are designed to be bolted into standard network racks. A typical workgroup switch will come with 24 or 48 access ports for client PCs, servers, and printers. These switches have uplink ports allowing them to be connected to other switches.

# 2.2.3 Access Points
----
Wireless technologies use radio waves as transmission media. Radio systems use transmission and reception antennas tuned to a specific frequency for the transfer of signals. Most wireless LANs (WLANs) are based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, better known by the brand name Wi-Fi.

Most Wi-Fi networks are configured in what is technically referred to as "infrastructure mode." Infrastructure mode means that each client device (station) is configured to connect to the network via an access point (AP). In 802.11 documentation, this is referred to as an infrastructure "Basic Service Set" (BSS). The MAC address of the AP’s radio is used as the Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID).

An access point can establish a wireless-only network, but it can also work as a bridge to forward communications between the wireless stations and a wired network. The wired network is referred to as the "distribution system" (DS). The access point will be joined to the network in much the same way as a host computer is—via a wall port and cabling to an Ethernet switch. An enterprise network is likely to use Power over Ethernet (PoE) to power the AP over the data cabling.
# 2.2.4 Patch Panels
----
In most types of office cabling, the computer is connected to a wall port and—via cabling running through the walls—to a patch panel. The cables running through the walls are terminated to insulation displacement connector (IDC) punchdown blocks at the back of the panel.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230916131348.png)


The other side of the patch panel has prewired RJ45 ports. A patch cord is used to connect a port on the patch panel to a port on an Ethernet switch. This cabling design makes it easier to change how any given wall port location is connected to the network via switch ports.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230916131357.png)

It is vital to use an effective labeling system when installing structured cabling so that you know which patch panel port is connected to which wall port.
# 2.2.5 Firewall
----
Once you have joined public and private networks using a router, you then need to control which computers are allowed to connect to them and which types of traffic you will accept. The role of filtering allowed and denied hosts and protocols is performed by a network firewall. A basic firewall is configured with rules, referred to as a network access control list (ACL). Each entry in the ACL lists source and/or destination network addresses and protocol types and whether to allow or block traffic that matches the rule.

Firewalls can also be deployed within a private network. For example, you might only want certain clients to connect to a particular group of servers. You could place the servers behind a local network firewall to enforce the relevant ACL.

Most routers can implement some level of firewall functionality. A firewall can be implemented as a standalone appliance. These dedicated appliances can perform deeper analysis of application protocol data and use more sophisticated rules to determine what traffic is allowed. They are often implemented as unified threat management (UTM) appliances to perform multiple other security functions.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230916131857.png)

There are also personal or software firewalls. These are installed to a single computer rather than working to protect a network segment.
# 2.2.6 Power over Ethernet (POE)
----
Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a means of supplying electrical power from a switch port over ordinary data cabling to a powered device (PD), such as a voice over IP (VoIP) handset, camera, or wireless access point. PoE is defined in several IEEE standards:

802.3af allows powered devices to draw up to about 13 W. Power is supplied as 350mA@48V and limited to 15.4 W, but the voltage drop over the maximum 100 feet of cable results in usable power of around 13 W.
802.3at (PoE+) allows powered devices to draw up to about 25 W, with a maximum current of 600 mA.
802.3bt (PoE++ or 4PPoE) supplies up to about 51 W (Type 3) or 73 W (Type 4) usable power.
A PoE-enabled switch is referred to as endspan power sourcing equipment (PSE). When a device is connected to a port on a PoE switch, the switch goes through a detection phase to determine whether the device is PoE enabled. If so, it determines the device's power consumption and sets an appropriate supply voltage level. If not, it does not supply power over the port and, therefore, does not damage non-PoE devices.

Powering these devices through a switch is more efficient than using a wall-socket AC adapter for each appliance. It also allows network management software to control the devices and apply energy saving schemes, such as making unused devices go into sleep states and power capping.

If the switch does not support PoE, a device called a "power injector" (or "midspan") can be used. One port on the injector is connected to the switch port. The other port is connected to the device. The overall cable length cannot exceed 100m.
# 2.2.7 Hub
----
A hub is a legacy network hardware device that was used to implement the 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T Ethernet cabling designs. This design is referred to as a star topology" because each end system is cabled to a concentrator (the hub).

A hub has a number of ports—typically between four and 48—and each computer is cabled to one port. The circuitry in the hub repeats an incoming transmission from a computer attached to one port across all the other ports. In effect, the computers seem to be attached to the same cable. Each computer attached to a hub receives all the traffic sent by other connected devices. This is referred to as a "collision domain."
![](Pasted%20image%2020230916135538.png)
Each computer will ignore any frames that do not match its MAC address. However, when lots of computers are in the same collision domain, performance is reduced, as only one computer can send a frame at any one time. If two computers try to send at the same time, there is a collision, and they must wait for a random period before trying again. The more computers there are, the more collisions. The computers contend for a share of the media bandwidth and all communications are half-duplex. Half-duplex means that the computer can send or receive, but not at the same time.

As well as the effect of contention on performance, there are no hubs that are compatible with Gigabit Ethernet. These limitations mean that almost all networks are now based on Ethernet switching. You are only likely to encounter a hub being used in very specific circumstances, such as where legacy equipment must be kept in service.

# 2.2.9 DSL
----
Many internet connection types make use of the national and global telecommunications network referred to as the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The core of the PSTN is fiber optic, but at its edge, it is still often composed of legacy two-pair copper cabling. This low-grade copper wire segment is referred to as theplain old telephone system (POTS), "local loop," or "last mile."

**Digital subscriber line (DSL)** uses the higher frequencies available in these copper telephone lines as a communications channel. The use of advanced modulation and echo cancelling techniques enable high bandwidth, full duplex transmissions.

There are various "flavors" of DSL, notably asymmetrical and symmetrical types:

- Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL) provides a fast downlink but a slow uplink. There are various iterations of ADSL, with the latest (ADSL2+) offering downlink rates up to about 24 Mbps and uplink rates of 1.25 Mbps or 2.5 Mbps.
- Symmetric versions of DSL offer the same uplink and downlink speeds. These are of more use to businesses and for branch office links, where more data is transferred upstream than with normal Internet use.

The customer network is connected to the telephone cabling via a DSL modem. The DSL modem might be provisioned as a separate device or be an embedded as a function of a SOHO router. On a standalone DSL modem, the RJ11 WAN port on the modem connects to the phone point. The RJ45 interface connects the modem to the router.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230916141202.png)
A filter (splitter) must be installed to each phone socket to separate voice and data signals. These can be self-installed on each phone point by the customer. Modern sockets are likely to feature a built-in splitter.

# 2.2.10 Fiber (Optical Network Terminal ONT)
----
The major obstacle to providing internet access that can perform like a LAN is bandwidth in the last mile, where the copper wiring infrastructure is often low grade. The projects to update this wiring to use fiber optic links are referred to by the umbrella term fiber to the X (FTTx).

Fiber to the Curb and VDSL

A fiber to the curb (FTTC) solution retains some sort of copper wiring to the customer premises while extending the fiber link from the point of presence to a communications cabinet servicing multiple subscribers. The service providers with their roots in telephone networks use very high-speed DSL (VDSL) to support FTTC. VDSL achieves higher bit rates than other DSL types at the expense of range. It allows for both symmetric and asymmetric modes. Over 300 m (1,000 feet), an asymmetric link supports 52 Mbps downstream and 6 Mbps upstream, while a symmetric link supports 26 Mbps in both directions. VDSL2 specifies a very short range (100 m/300 feet) rate of 100 Mbps (bi-directional).

### Fiber to the Premises and Optical Network Terminals

A fiber to the premises (FTTP) Internet connection means that the service provider’s fiber optic cable is run all the way to the customer’s building. This full fiber connection type is implemented as a passive optical network (PON). In a PON, a single fiber cable is run from the point of presence to an optical line terminal (OLT) located in a street cabinet. From the OLT, splitters direct each subscriber’s traffic over a shorter length of fiber to an **optical network terminal (ONT)** installed at the customer’s premises. The ONT converts the optical signal to an electrical one. The ONT is connected to the customer’s router using an RJ45 copper wire patch cord.

# 2.2.11 NIC
----
Ethernet communications are established by either electrical signaling over copper twisted pair cable or pulses of light transmitted over fiber optic cable. The physical connection to the cable is made using a transceiver port in the computer's network interface card (NIC). All PC motherboards have a built-in 1000BASE-T compatible adapter. You might use an NIC adapter card to support other types of Ethernet, such as fiber optic. You can also purchase cards with multiple ports of the same type—two or four 1000BASE-T ports, for instance. The multiple ports can be bonded to create a higher-speed link. Four Gigabit Ethernet ports could be bonded to give a nominal link speed of 4 Gbps.

For the NIC to be able to process the electrical or light signals as digital data, the signals must be divided into regular units with a consistent format. There must also be a means for each node on the local network to address communications to other nodes. Ethernet provides a data link protocol to perform these framing and addressing functions.

Each Ethernet NIC port has a unique hardware/physical address, called the "media access control" (MAC) address. Each frame of Ethernet data identifies the source MAC address and destination MAC address in fields in a header.

A MAC address consists of 48 binary digits, making it six bytes in size. A MAC address is typically represented as 12 digits of hexadecimal. Hex is a numbering system often used to represent network addresses of different types. A hex digit can be one of sixteen values: 0–9 and then A, B, C, D, E, F. Each hex digit represents half a byte (or four bits or a nibble). The 12 digits of a MAC address might be written with colon or hyphen separators or no separators at all—for example, 

# 2.2.12 Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
----
Cloud services require the rapid provisioning and deprovisioning of server instances and networks. This means that these components must be fully accessible to scripting. **Software-defined networking (SDN)** is a model for how these processes can be used to provision and deprovision networks.

In the SDN model defined by IETF ([datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7426](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7426/)), network functions are divided into three layers. The top and bottom layers are application and infrastructure:

- The application layer applies business logic to make decisions about how traffic should be prioritized and secured and where it should be switched.
- The infrastructure layer contains the devices (physical or virtual) that handle the actual forwarding (switching and routing) of traffic.

The principal innovation of SDN is to insert a control layer between the application and infrastructure layers. The functions of the control plane are implemented by a virtual device referred to as the "SDN controller." Each layer exposes an application programming interface (API) that can be automated by scripts that call functions in the layer above or below. The interface between SDN applications and the SDN controller is described as the service interface or as the "northbound" API, while that between the SDN controller and infrastructure devices is the "southbound" API.
