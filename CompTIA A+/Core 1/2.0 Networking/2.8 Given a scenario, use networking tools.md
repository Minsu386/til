# Copper Cabling Installation Tools

Data cable for a typical office is installed as a structured cabling system. With structured cabling, the network adapter port in each computer is connected to a wall port using a flexible patch cord. Behind the wall port, permanent cable is run through the wall and ceiling to an equipment room and connected to a patch panel. The port on the patch panel is then connected to a port on an Ethernet switch.

A structured cabling system uses two types of cable termination:

- Patch cords are terminated using RJ45 plugs crimped to the end of the cable.

Permanent cable is terminated to wall ports and patch panels using insulation displacement connectors (IDC), also referred to as "**punchdown blocks**."

*The 100 m distance limitation is for the whole link, referred to as "channel link." Each patch cord can only be up to 5 m long. Permanent link use solid cable with thicker wires. Patch cords use stranded cable with thinner wires that is more flexible but also suffers more from attenuation.*

Installing cable in this type of system involves the use of cable strippers, punchdown tools, and crimpers.

## Cable Stripper and Snips

To terminate cable, a small section of outer jacket must be removed to expose the wire pairs. This must be done without damaging the insulation on the inner wire pairs. A **cable stripper** is designed to score the outer jacket just enough to allow it to be removed. Set the stripper to the correct diameter, and then place the cable in the stripper and rotate the tool once or twice. The score cut in the insulation should now allow you to remove the section of jacket.![](Pasted%20image%2020230920170702.png)

Most Cat 6 and all Cat 6A cable has a plastic star filler running through it that keeps the pairs separated. You need to use electrician’s scissors (snips) to cut off the end of this before terminating the cable. There will also be a nylon thread called a "ripcord." This can be pulled down the jacket to open it up more if you damaged any of the wire pairs initially. Snip any excess ripcord before terminating the cable.

## PunchDown Tool
A **punchdown too**l is used to fix each conductor into an IDC. First, untwist the wire pairs, and lay them in the color-coded terminals in the IDC in the appropriate termination order (T568A or T568B). To reduce the risk of interference, no more than ½” (13 mm) should be untwisted. Use the punchdown tool to press each wire into the terminal. Blades in the terminal cut through the insulation to make an electrical contact with the wire.

## Crimper
A **crimper** is used to fix a jack to a patch cord. Orient the RJ45 plug so that the tab latch is underneath. Pin 1 is the first pin on the left. Arrange the wire pairs in the appropriate order (T568A or T568B), and then push them into the RJ45 plug. Place the plug in the crimper tool, and close it tightly to pierce the wire insulation at the pins and seal the jack to the outer cable jacket.

# Copper Cabling Test Tools
----
Once you have terminated cable, you must test it to ensure that each wire makes a good electrical contact and is in the correct pin position. The best time to verify wiring installation and termination is just after you have made all the connections. This means you should still have access to the cable runs. Identifying and correcting errors at this point will be much simpler than when you are trying to set up end user devices.

You can use several cabling and infrastructure troubleshooting devices to assist with this process.

## Cable Tester

A **cable tester** is a pair of devices designed to attach to each end of a cable. It can be used to test a patch cord or connected via patch cords to a wall port and patch panel port to test the permanent link. The tester energizes each wire in turn, with an LED indicating successful termination. If an LED does not activate, the wire is not conducting a signal, typically because the insulation is damaged or the wire isn’t properly inserted into the plug or IDC. If the LEDs do not activate in the same sequence at each end, the wires have been terminated to different pins at each end. Use the same type of termination on both ends.

## Toner Probe
Many cable testers also incorporate the function of a **toner probe**, which is used to identify a cable from within a bundle. This may be necessary when the cables have not been labeled properly. The tone generator is connected to the cable using an RJ45 jack and applies a continuous audio signal on the cable. The probe is used to detect the signal and follow the cable over ceilings and through ducts or identify it from within the rest of the bundle.

## Loopback Plug
A **loopback plug** is used to test an NIC or switch port. You can make a basic loopback plug from a 6” cable stub where the wires connect pin 1 to pin 3 and pin 2 to pin 6. When you connect a loopback plug to a port, you should see a solid link LED showing that the port can send and receive.

## Network Taps
A **network tap** is used to intercept the signals passing over a cable and send them to a packet or protocol analyzer. Taps are either powered or unpowered:

- A **passive test access point** (TAP) is a box with ports for incoming and outgoing network cabling and an inductor or optical splitter that physically copies the signal from the cabling to a monitor port. No logic decisions are made, so the monitor port receives every frame—corrupt or malformed or not—and the copying is unaffected by load.
- An **active TAP** is a powered device that performs signal regeneration, which may be necessary in some circumstances. Gigabit signaling over copper wire is too complex for a passive tap to monitor, and some types of fiber links may be adversely affected by optical splitting. Because it performs an active function, the TAP becomes a point of failure for the links during power loss.
