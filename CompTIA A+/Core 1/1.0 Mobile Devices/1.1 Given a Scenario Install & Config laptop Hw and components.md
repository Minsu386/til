**HVAC, Interference, magnetic fields**


|Consideration|Description|
|---|---|
|Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  <br>(HVAC)|For computer components, design HVAC systems with the following in mind:<br><br>- Keep the temperature between 70 and 74 degrees to prevent components from overheating.<br>- Keep humidity between 40 and 70 percent to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD).<br>- Make sure server rooms have separate ducting or HVAC systems from the rest of the building for better temperature control.<br>- Use positive pressure systems. Positive pressure systems protect the air quality in the facility by causing air to be forced out through doors, windows, and other openings. Negative pressure systems draw air in, potentially bringing in airborne particles such as dust or smoke. Positive pressure systems are more energy effective.<br>- In areas with heavy smoke or dust, add filters to air intake systems to filter out airborne particulates.|
|Interference|_Interference_ is a signal that corrupts or destroys regular signals. Interference affects signals used by two devices to communicate on a network. Listed below are two types of interference that affect computer networks:  <br><br>- _Electromagnetic interference (EMI)_ is interference that affects wired network signals.<br>- - EMI is caused by motors, heavy machinery, and fluorescent lights.<br>    - Use shielded twisted pair cable to protect signals sent on Ethernet twisted pair cabling. If necessary, use fiber optic cables to eliminate the effects of interference.<br>- _Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)_ is interference on the radio channel used by wireless networking devices.<br>- - RFI can be caused by nearby wireless devices using the same channel, cordless phones, or microwave ovens.<br>    - Wireless networks that use the 2.4 GHz frequency range (801.11b and 802.11g) are susceptible to RFI.<br>    - You can reduce RFI by using a wireless networking standard that operates in the 5.75 GHz range or using a different channel for wireless devices.|
|Magnetic fields|Magnetic fields located close to a computer can cause undesired effects or even data loss.<br><br>- Hard drives use magnetic charges to store data. While hard disks are shielded and protected from all but the strongest magnets, getting a magnet too close to these components could erase data.<br>- Speakers, motors, and generators contain magnets (keep sensitive components away from these devices).<br>- Solid-state storage devices (such as RAM or flash drives) are not affected by magnetic fields.|

**Computer Cleaning**

One of the best things you can do to keep your system running efficiently is to keep it clean. Be aware of the following facts about cleaning your computer:

- Common computer cleaning supplies include:
- - Lint-free cloth
    - Compressed air or an air compressor
    - Small anti-static vacuum
    - Denatured or isopropyl alcohol
- Regular cleaning gives you the chance to inspect all components. Look for worn or failed components. On electrical components, dark areas might indicate a burned-out component.
- Before cleaning computer components, power down and unplug components and let them sit for at least 30 minutes to cool.
- Use caution with liquid-based cleansers. Use small amounts and always apply cleaning solutions to cloths and cleaning instruments, never directly to component surfaces.
- Dust buildup inside a computer acts as an insulator for internal components, trapping heat and preventing adequate cooling of components. Use:
- - Compressed air to blow off.
    - A non-static vacuum to remove dust.
    - A natural bristle paintbrush to wipe components off.
- Use a small amount of denatured alcohol on a cotton swab to clean electrical connectors (such as those on expansion cards).
- For LCD screens, use a lint-free dry cloth or a small amount of isopropyl alcohol (do not use window cleaner, ammonium-based cleaners, paper towels). You can also use special monitor-cleaning solutions or pre-packaged wipes with a monitor-safe solution.
- For keyboards, use a vacuum or compressed air. For keys that stick, use a lint-free cloth and/or cleaning swabs, lightly dampened, to gently wipe each key.
- To clean a printer, use a damp or dry cloth.
- - On inkjet printers, use the printer's cleaning function to clean the print heads.
    - For laser printers, use an anti-static vacuum to remove excess toner. A regular vacuum will build up an electrostatic charge from the toner.


**Management**
Be aware of the following tips for maintaining your computer:

- When receiving a new computer or component that has been shipped, let it sit for at least six hours (24 hours if it arrives in outside freezing conditions) before applying power. The rapid change in temperature can cause damage to components or can result in condensation within the computer.
- Perform regular backups. Backups protect your data if a hard disk fails.
- You can use covers and cases to protect some equipment from dust and liquid spills. Be sure to remove covers before use and replace them after use.
- Keep cables organized. Route cables to prevent them from being kinked or stepped on. For best results, use cable ties to bind and organize cables.
- Verify that your system's cooling fans are blowing air through the system case in the correct directions. A fan blowing in the wrong direction can negate the airflow through the case and cause the system to overheat.

**Disk Drive Upgrade**
Optimizing a hard disk drive can improve a computer's overall performance. The following table describes upgrade features you can use to optimize hard disk performance.

|Features|Description|
|---|---|
|Upgrade the hard disk|Upgrade to the fastest disk possible. Disk drives come in a variety of rotation speeds such as:<br><br>- 5400 RPM (not desired)<br>- 7200 RPM (minimum)<br>- 10,000 RPM<br>- 15,000 RPM<br><br>Some hard drives do not use rotating disks such as:<br><br>- Solid-state drives<br>- NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) solid-state drive<br>- NVMe M.2 (nonvolatile memory express) solid-state drive|
|Upgrade the disk interface|Upgrading a disk interface significantly improves the throughput of data to and from a disk drive. For optimal performance, consider upgrading to PCIe. This will upgrade the speed to 4,000 Mbps.|

**Disk Cleanup**
A mostly full drive can run slower than a mostly empty one. The following table lists a few of the methods you can use to clean up a disk drive.

|App/Utility|Description|
|---|---|
|Disk Cleanup app|The Disk Cleanup app helps manage disks by locating and disposing of files that can be safely removed from the disk. It:<br><br>- Empties the Recycle Bin.<br>- Deletes temporary files such as those used by a web browser or for application installation.<br>- Deletes installation log files.<br>- Deletes offline files.<br>- Compresses old files.<br><br>To run Disk Cleanup, type 'disk cleanup' in the Windows search box. Then select the Disk Cleanup app from the Best match list.|
|Optimize Drives app|The Optimize Drives app optimizes the performance of a hard drive by joining fragments of files that are in different locations on the hard drive.<br><br>- To improve defragmentation, disable programs such as screensavers and virus software that run in the background. Any disk access (whether reading from or writing to the disk) while Disk Defragmenter is running slows down the defragmentation process.<br>- The more information that is on the drive, the more time it will take to defragment the drive.<br><br>It is important to not defragment or optimize a solid-state drive (SSD). Although files can become fragmented on an SSD, it is not important to defragment them because the seek time is about 0.1ms.  <br>  <br>To run Optimize Drives, type 'Defrag' in the Windows search box. Select the Defragment and Optimize Drives app from the Best match list. You can also run this app as follows:<br><br>1. Open File Explorer and select This PC.<br>2. Right-click the drive you want to defragment and select **Properties**.<br>3. From the Tools tab, under Optimize and defragment drive, select **Optimize**.|
|Check Disk  <br>(Chkdsk)|Check Disk (chkdsk) is a utility that verifies the file system integrity of a hard disk. Errors that can be checked and fixed by Check Disk include:<br><br>- Lost clusters. These are a series of used clusters on the hard disk drive that are not associated with a specific file.<br>- Cross-linked files. This occurs when two files claim the same cluster. Check Disk identifies cross-linked files and corrects the cluster associations.<br>- Orphaned files. These are files that exist on the hard drive but are not associated with a directory in the index. Normally Check Disk can re-associate the file with the correct directory.<br>- A bad sector. This is a portion of the hard disk that cannot be used. Bad sectors are marked so the system doesn't try to use them. Any used bad sectors are redirected to another sector.<br><br>You can run chkdsk by opening a Windows terminal and typing 'Chkdsk' at the PowerShell prompt.<br><br>- Use Chkdsk with the /f switch to automatically fix errors without scanning for bad sectors.<br>- Use the /r switch to scan and fix bad sectors and other errors.<br>- Use the /? command for help.|

### Facts
----
A peripheral device is any external component that either sends information to a computer or retrieves information from a computer.

This lesson covers peripheral devices.

**Peripheral Devices**
There are three categories of peripheral devices:

- Input devices
- Output devices
- Input & Output (I/O) devices

The following table describes some of the most common peripheral devices:

|Device|Considerations|
|---|---|
|Keyboard|Keyboards connect through a USB port. Many keyboards include special function keys that simplify playing music or browsing the internet. Some keyboards include a built-in USB port that can be used to connect other peripheral devices.<br><br>Almost every desktop computer requires at least a keyboard to function. Most computers require a keyboard, mouse, and display device in order to function properly.|
|Mouse|A mouse can be either wired or wireless.<br><br>- A wired mouse uses a USB port to connect to the computer.<br>- A wireless mouse uses an internal battery for power and uses RF signals (Bluetooth) to connect to a receiver that is either connected to a USB port or integrated with the computer.<br><br>When selecting a mouse, consider the following:<br><br>- Because optical mice use light rays to detect motion, they don't work on some surfaces.<br>- Some mice have internal motion sensors, allowing them to detect movements while in the air. This particular device can attach to a user's head and move the cursor when the head moves.<br>- You can select mice with additional buttons or a scroll wheel to add functionality.<br>- High-end gaming mice use a rating of dots per inch (DPI). The rating denotes how many steps (cursor movements) are counted in a single inch.|
|Digitizer|A digitizer captures some type of analog signal and converts it into digital data. Some common types of digitizer devices include:<br><br>- Graphics tables - Graphics tablets capture analog stylus strokes written on a pad and convert them to digital data. These are mostly used by graphic artists to capture hand-drawn images.<br>- Document Scanners - Document scanners are specifically designed to convert paper documents into digital documents, such as PDFs or Rich Text Format files. Document scanners use optical character recognition (OCR) to create editable word processor documents. There are two types of document scanners. Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) scanners automatically scan a stack of papers. Flatbed scanners require that you place each page on a scanning surface one by one.<br>- 3D Scanners - 3D scanners use either physical contact or lasers to map the size and shape of a physical object and convert it into a 3D digital model.|
|Game controllers|Game controllers are input devices designed specifically for computer gaming. There are two main types of game controllers:<br><br>- Gamepads are handheld controllers with directional controls on the left and buttons on the right.<br>- Joysticks consist of a stick that pivots on a base. Both the stick and the base have several input buttons. Joysticks are typically used with flight simulator games..|
|Scanner|Scanners are used to scan hard-copy images and documents and convert them into digital input for the PC. For example, film photos can be scanned and saved as image files.<br><br>Some scanners combine the functionality of a document scanner and are able to create editable documents.|
|Motion sensor|Motion sensors are devices that are able to detect the slightest amount of movement in an area. They are typically used with security systems and require special software and configuration. Two types of motion sensors exist:<br><br>- Active motion sensors use ultrasonic sound waves to detect movement in an area. If movement is detected, something happens (such as a door opening or an alarm).<br>- Passive motion sensors detect infrared energy, which is emitted by humans and animals. Passive motion sensors ignore small changes in infrared energy in order to avoid false alarms. Passive motion sensors are sometimes called passive infrared sensors (PIR).|
|Touch pad|Touch pads are typically found on notebook computers and are used in place of a mouse. Users slide their finger on the touch pad to manipulate the cursor. Touch pads can also be used with desktop computers. These touch pads connect to the computer through a USB port and are used instead of a mouse.|
|Card reader|A card that contains an embedded microchip or a magnetic strip is inserted into the reader. The reader then scans the chip or strip, verifies its contents, and authenticates the user. Card readers can be stand-alone devices or integrated with other peripherals (such as a keyboard or workstation).|
|Biometric scanner|Biometric scanners are used as a form of authentication. They are able to scan users' unique physical features and use them to verify their identity. Common physical features used by biometric scanners include:<br><br>- Retina (eyes)<br>- Fingerprint<br>- Face<br>- Heart beat|
|Barcode reader|A barcode reader is a device that can scan barcodes.<br><br>- Barcodes are most commonly used in retail environments at checkout stands. Shipping companies, hospitals, and other organizations use barcodes to track or inventory items.<br>- Most bar code readers use a laser to scan the barcode. Some use cameras or optical scanners.<br>- Barcode readers include software that interprets the meaning of the barcode.<br><br>By installing a special app, smart phones are able to function as a barcode reader by using the phone's built-in camera.|
|Near Field Communication (NFC)/ Tap Pay device|NFC is a set of communication protocols that allows devices to communicate when they are within 1.6 inches of one another. NFC technology is most often employed between a base and a smart phone to allow Tap Pay transactions at stores and restaurants; the user places their phone within proximity of the base and uses an app to make an electronic transactions from their mobile phone. NFC is also used to share contacts, photos, videos, and documents, such as identity documents and key cards.|
|Virtual reality (VR) headset|A device worn on the head that covers the eyes and provides separate images for each eye, stereo sound, and motion tracking sensors to create a virtual reality experience for the user. Some headsets also have eye tracking sensors and work with handheld gaming controllers. Virtual reality is widely used to train medical and military professionals. As it becomes more affordable, it is being widely adopted in many fields.|
|Microphone|A microphone converts sound into an electrical signal. Some computers have a built-in microphone, and many headsets and camera systems that connect to computers include microphones.|
|Signature pad|Signature pads are used to obtain signatures for transactions and agreements. The user uses a stylus on a touch screen to sign his or her name. The signature is captured and stored digitally. Signature pads are commonly used in retail stores and restaurants.|
|Projector|Projectors are display devices that use light to project display output onto a wall or screen. Projectors are often used in classrooms and meetings to display information for a large audience. The brightness of light from projectors and other output devices is measured in lumens. Projectors may use light-emitting diodes (LEDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), or other hardware.|
|KVM switch|A KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch allows multiple computers to use a single keyboard, mouse, and monitor. KVM switches have multiple input groups, with each group accepting keyboard, video, and mouse connections from one computer. A single output group connects to the shared peripheral devices. Buttons on the KVM switch are used to toggle between each connected computer.<br><br>- Rackmount KVM switches can support up to 16 computers and are typically used in data centers to manage servers from a central console.<br>- Desktop KVM switches typically support two or three computers, which must be within about 5 meters.<br>- Networked or remote KVM switches use special hardware devices that send keyboard, mouse, and video content through a network connection.|

When connecting peripheral devices, consider the following recommendations:

- Make sure the computer supports the connection type used by the device.
    - Most peripheral devices use USB connectors.
    - Older peripheral devices can use PS/2, serial, or parallel connectors. For these devices, you can use an adapter (e.g., a PS/2 to USB adapter).
    - An expansion card can be added to provide the necessary connections.
- Identify the system requirements of the peripheral device. Some peripheral devices specify a minimum CPU speed, memory size, or OS version.
- Install any necessary drivers or software.
- Configure the device in the OS and verify that it is working correctly.

## 12.1 Laptop Slide 1 | 58mins
### Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Portable devices
- Laptop components

**Portable Devices**
Notebooks and other portable devices differ from desktop systems in three significant ways:

- Portable devices are built to be light and easy to carry.
- Portable devices often use battery power. Individual components are engineered to maximize battery life by minimizing power consumption.
- Since the devices are engineered for mobility, they also must withstand more wear and tear.

Be aware of the following classifications for portable devices.

- _Laptops_ and _notebooks_ are portable versions of a desktop system. They often have similar hardware as desktop system and run similar software.
- A _tablet PC_ is a notebook that includes a touch screen to allow input by tapping the screen, dragging objects, or writing on the screen. A stylus is a special pen designed for touch screen input. Tablet PCs might run special versions of the operating system to enable touch screen input.
- A _smart phone_ is a phone that includes many other functions and supports applications. Applications come bundled with the smart phone and are also available for download. Many apps use the components of a smart phone such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) and touch screen.
- A _chromebook_ is a special version of a notebook computer that uses an internet browser as the operating system. All applications can and must run inside of the browser.

**Laptop Components**
The following table describes various components in a laptop system.

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|Processor|Processors built especially for laptop computers have lower power consumption requirements and produce less heat than desktop processors.<br><br>- On most systems, you can configure the processor to use a lower bus speed when running from battery power. This conserves battery life.<br>- Many mobile processors use automatic throttling to turn off extra cores or reduce the processor speed to conserve energy.<br>- Processors do not have the large heat sink and fan combination to dissipate heat. Rather, heat is controlled by minimizing power consumption and small fans that draw heat away.|
|Memory|Laptop memory uses SODIMM and UniDIMM packages with SDRAM and DDR/DDR2/DDR3/DDR4 memory. These modules are often referred to as MicroDIMMs.  <br>  <br>Many notebooks come with a base amount of memory built onto the motherboard and two or more additional memory slots. When replacing notebook memory, make sure the size, speed, and type of modules you purchase are supported by the system.|
|Keyboard|Notebook keyboards are smaller than standard keyboards. Keys are often a bit smaller and closer together. Keys such as the number pad and some function (Fn) keys might not be on the keyboard, but the functionality is accessible by pressing a special key to provide alternate functions for regular keys.<br><br>You can use a USB port to connect an external keyboard; some laptops include a PS/2 port.|
|Pointing devices|Instead of a mouse, notebooks use one (or more) of the following devices.<br><br>- Pointing sticks are small knobs in the center of the keyboard. Moving the knob moves the cursor.<br>- The touchpad is located below the keyboard. Moving your finger across the pad moves the mouse. You can also tap the touchpad to click the mouse.<br>- Buttons below the keyboard replace mouse buttons for clicks, double-clicks, and right-clicks.<br>- You can use a digitizer pad in laptop and PDA systems to receive input. You write input onto the pad with a stylus pen. The system converts the motions into data that it processes.<br>- You can also connect a mouse to an available USB port or use Bluetooth to connect an external mouse wirelessly.<br><br>Touchpads are more common than pointing sticks. Notebooks with a pointing stick often come with a touchpad as well.|
|Video|Be aware of the following facts about screens and video cards.<br><br>- XGA screens have the normal 4:3 aspect ratio. WXGA screens use a widescreen aspect ratio.<br>- Some screens promise a brighter display for crisper viewing or better outdoor viewing.<br>- The video controller is either integrated onto the motherboard or a separate system component.<br>- Video memory typically shares a portion of the system memory; although, some notebooks have dedicated video memory.<br>- Most notebooks have an external video port that you can use to display the screen on a projector or external monitor. These are often HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C.<br>- Some laptops allow you to extend the screen across multiple monitors. You can connect an external monitor to a laptop if you need dual display (multiple monitor) functionality. Typically, the second display duplicates the notebook native display.<br>- Some notebooks have special touch screens that can rotate 180 degrees. This allows the screen to be visible when you close the notebook.<br>- Some notebooks allow you to detach or remove the screen from the keyboard. This turns the notebook into a tablet.|
|Networking|Most notebooks include built-in networking devices such as an Ethernet port, WiFi, Bluetooth, and/or infrared.<br><br>- Wireless networking capabilities are often provided by a small card that plugs into an internal mini-PCI slot (located under the keyboard or accessible through the back). The wireless antennae might be a wire that extends around the screen.<br>- You can use USB or ExpressCards to add missing or malfunctioning networking features.|
|Internal storage|Internal storage may vary from rotational/magnetic drives to solid-state or M.2/NVMe. Although capacity varies, internal storage is usually measured in terabytes (TB).|
|Port replicator  <br>(docking station)|A port replicator device provides ports for monitors, keyboards, mice, etc. The port replicator provides the desktop experience for portable computers without having to plug in each component.|

### Special Key Facts
**Laptop Special Keys**
A function (Fn) key is a keyboard modifier key that allows the keyboard to perform additional functions without adding keys. The Fn key is typically used on notebooks (because of their compact keyboard design) and on full-sized multimedia keyboards.

Keys that have a special function when pressed with the Fn key are identified by a small icon or word that is typically the same color as the Fn key. For example, the F1 key on a notebook might have a small moon icon in the corner of the key indicating that the Fn+F1 key combination puts the notebook to sleep.

The following table lists the most common key icons used by laptops and the associated function they perform:

Many desktop keyboards also have special functions and keys depending on the manufacturer and rely on device drivers for their function.

### Upgrade and Repair Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Repair and upgrade considerations
- Laptop considerations

**Repair and upgrade Considerations**
When upgrading or repairing laptop components, keep the following in mind:

- To identify the source of problems on a notebook, plug in a known good external component. For example:
    - If the keyboard doesn't work, plug an external keyboard into an available USB slot.
    - If the video display doesn't work, connect an external monitor. You must use a compatible monitor for the type of external monitor connection.
- If the external device works but the internal device doesn't, then replace the internal device if possible.
    
    Most notebook hardware components are not user replaceable. Only qualified personnel should replace notebook components.
    
- Some notebook components are built into the motherboard and cannot be replaced without replacing the entire motherboard.
- An alternative to replacing failed components (due of cost) is to add external components. For example, you can connect an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to replace a failed one.
- Notebooks vary considerably in design and composition. Consult the documentation to find the location of screws and to identify installation sequences.
- Notebook parts are not as standardized as other PC components. In many cases, you must order replacement parts from the manufacturer to get the correct part.
- Components with a high degree of standardization include the processor, memory, and internal storage.
- Before servicing a portable device, unplug it and remove any batteries.
- Plastic case components are either screwed or snapped into place. For pieces of the case that snap into place, use a plastic tool to carefully pry the piece off.

**Laptop Considerations**
The following table lists factors to consider when working with various components.

|Device|Considerations|
|---|---|
|Internal storage|Internal storage varies in physical size and shape.<br><br>- Verify the interface type (e.g., SATA and M.2), speed, capacity, and RPM speed supported by the notebook before purchasing a replacement drive.<br>- Most often, storage devices are replaced by removing a cover on the bottom or side of the notebook.<br>- Sometimes, components are placed inside a caddy with a special connector. You need this caddy when replacing the drive.|
|Memory|Most notebooks use a small panel on the bottom to access the additional memory slots.<br><br>- Some notebooks include a base amount of memory built onto the motherboard or a memory module soldered into the first memory slot. You can't remove or upgrade this memory.<br>- Some notebooks have one memory slot located underneath the keyboard and a second slot accessible through a door on the bottom of the case. In other notebooks, both slots are accessible from the bottom.<br>- The amount of base memory installed affects the total amount of system memory you can have. Consult the system documentation to determine maximum memory size supported.|
|Keyboard|When experiencing issues with the keyboard:<br><br>- Cleaning the keyboard might correct stuck keys or keys that will not display a character when typed.<br>- If numbers type instead of letters (such as 1 for J, 2 for K, etc.), make sure that the Num Lock feature is turned off.<br>- If the keyboard doesn't work, you can connect an external keyboard to continue using the system until the keyboard is replaced.<br><br>When replacing the keyboard, be aware of the following.<br><br>- You can replace the pointer stick pad by pulling off the old one and replacing it.<br>- Screws at the bottom of the notebook case or underneath a plastic bevel on the top hold the keyboard in place.<br>- A laptop keyboard is typically connected to the system board using a flat, ribbon-like cable.<br>- You typically need to remove the keyboard to replace other internal components (such as the processor, wireless card, or video card).|
|Touchpad|The touchpad takes the place of a mouse.<br><br>- The most common problem for the touchpad is that the mouse cursor is not controlled properly based on where you press. In this case, recalibrate the touchpad.<br>    - Some notebooks recalibrate the touchpad at every system boot. Reboot the computer, making sure not to press the touchpad during startup.<br>    - Most notebooks include a utility for calibrating the touchpad. Run the utility and follow the instructions to recalibrate.<br>    - A tablet PC with a touch screen might also need to be recalibrated periodically.<br>- If you need to replace the touchpad, it is typically connected to the palm rest which is part of the inside case. You remove the keyboard and the palm rest to replace the touchpad.<br>- Clearing the Leave touchpad on when a mouse is connected setting can cause the touchpad to not work when the USB mouse is connected.|
|Wireless network card|Wireless network cards might be integrated onto the motherboard or added through add-on cards.<br><br>- You can use mini-PCI or mini-PCIe slots to add devices such as a wireless card.<br>- Some card slots might be accessible through a panel on the bottom; others are underneath the memory or the hard drive. Otherwise, you must remove the keyboard and the palm rest (or the rest of the case) to access the expansion slots.<br>- Wireless cards require an antenna. Connectors on the card connect to the antenna, which is usually a wire routed into the lid and around the display.<br>- Be sure to reconnect both the antenna and keyboard connectors when reassembling.|
|Processor|The processor is typically located underneath the keyboard.<br><br>- Remove the keyboard to expose the processor.<br>- Some notebooks have processors soldered onto the motherboard. On these systems, you will not be able to upgrade or replace the processor.<br>- Due to the limited space in a notebook case, the processor uses a heat pipe to pull heat towards the side of the case where a small fan can vent the heat from the case.|
|LCD Display|Multiple components make up the LCD display.<br><br>- The _bezel_ is the case in which the LCD is set.<br>- The _backlight_ illuminates the LCD by evenly dispersing light over the entire screen. These backlights are usually cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) or LEDs.<br>- The _inverter_ is a power supply for the LCD screen that converts the DC power used by the computer to AC power needed for the backlight.<br>    <br>    An inverter is not used with LED backlights because LEDs use DC power.<br>    <br>- The remainder of the LCD screen comes as a unit.<br>- The antenna for wireless network cards is typically housed in the display bezel.<br><br>When replacing video components:<br><br>- You will need to remove the keyboard and any palm rests in order to remove the video card or the display components.<br>- Some video cards are integrated on the motherboard and cannot be replaced. If the video card can be replaced, disconnect the display wires first.<br>- Power cables run from the laptop to the LCD through the hinges that attach the LCD to the laptop. If these cables become bent or frayed, they can cause the LCD to lose power.<br>- To remove the display assembly, remove the screws holding the lid (typically located beneath the keyboard or a plastic cover above the keyboard). Unplug the video cables and the wireless antenna or other device cables.<br>- To access the inverter, backlight, or other display components, remove the screws in the bezel. These screws are typically underneath rubber pads that keep the lid from hitting the palm rests.<br>- When replacing the video card or LCD components, be sure to reconnect the wireless network antenna when reassembling.|

Laptops are built to very stringent specifications. Often, component connections are very small and fragile. It is easy to break or rip a connector rendering the system unusable. Only trained and knowledgeable personnel should attempt laptop repairs.

### Power Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Laptop power management
- Advanced Configuration Power Interface (ACPI)
- Windows Fast Startup
- USB selective suspend

**Power Management**
Laptop systems are designed to use as little power as possible. To save power, laptops:

- Turn off drives that aren't currently being used.
- Step down the bus speed in the CPU.
- Turn off the monitor after a period of inactivity.
- Put the computer to sleep or turn it off automatically.

A laptop plugged into an outlet receives power through an adapter that converts the AC power from the outlet to DC power usable by the computer. You can use most adapters on both 110 and 220 AC volt power sources. The power from the adapter runs the laptop system and charges the battery.

Remember that most adapters are not interchangeable between laptops. Laptops require varying amounts of voltage and amperage. They also use different plugs. Before connecting a laptop to an adapter, make sure the power adapter is the correct adapter for the laptop. Also, make sure the plug is the correct size and fits easily into the laptop.

Failing to use the correct adapter can cause a laptop to:

- Receive insufficient power to turn on.
- Receive insufficient power to charge the battery.
- Receive an excess of power that may cause damage to the system.

**ACPI**
Many portable devices use ACPI to save power and manage its use within the device. ACPI is designed to prolong and optimize battery life. The host operating system often implements and controls ACPI management. In Windows, for example, you change ACPI settings using Control Panel.

ACPI controls the distribution of power as follows:

- Alters amount of power sent to the CPU to control processing.
- Dims or turns off display.
- Powers down internal storage devices.

The ACPI power states are described in the following table.

|Power State|Characteristic|
|---|---|
|Working|System is fully powered and operational.|
|Standby|System is in a low power state and can change quickly to the working state. RAM is fully powered; screen and storage devices are power down.|
|Sleep|Sleep is similar to standby. In many systems, sleep and standby are the same. On a Mac, the system goes into hibernate mode if the power level gets below a given threshold.|
|Hibernate|During hibernation, the contents of RAM are stored on internal storage to preserve system state; then, the system is completely powered down. When the system restarts, the contents of hibernation file are copied to RAM.|
|Off|System is shutdown and power to all devices including RAM are powered down.|

**Windows Fast Startup**
Windows Fast Startup changes how a machine shuts down. Typically, when a machine shuts down, all programs are closed and the machine is powered down. Key points of Windows Fast Startup are:

- When a user logs off, all open programs are hibernated.
- When the system is powered on, all open programs are restored to the system's state where the user left off.
- This is often called an hybrid shutdown.
- Windows Fast Startup is enabled by default.

**USB Selective Suspend**
When a device is connected to a USB port, it is not always in use. The USB selective suspend feature helps to conserve power when USB ports are not in use. Key points of USB selective suspend are:

- If the system detects the USB device is not in use, it will stop providing power to the port.
- When that device become active again, the system provides power to the port enabling the device.
- There may be a short delay accessing the USB device; however, the delay is hardly noticeable.


### Battery Facts
**Battery Types**
Mobile devices including laptop computers are powered with a battery. The past 20 years has seen extreme growth in battery technology.

|Battery|Characteristic|
|---|---|
|Nickel cadmium (NiCd or NiCad)|Nickel cadmium batteries:<br><br>- Develop a memory and begin to store less power as it is repeatedly recharged. To avoid battery memory problems, completely drain the battery before recharging it.<br>- Take up more physical space than newer technology batteries.<br>- Are very heat sensitive.<br>- Are no longer used on new laptops.|
|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)|Nickel metal hydride batteries:<br><br>- Do not develop a memory.<br>- Have a 40% longer lifetime than nickel cadmium batteries.<br>- Have a greater charge capacity than nickel cadmium.<br>- Are less toxic than nickel cadmium.<br>- Are slightly more expensive than nickel cadmium batteries.|
|Lithium-ion  <br>(Li-ion)|Lithium-ion batteries:<br><br>- Do not develop a memory.<br>- Are a rechargeable battery with twice the capacity of a nickel cadmium battery and have significantly increased stability and safety.<br>- Take up less physical space and weigh less than nickel cadmium or nickel metal hydride batteries with comparable power output.<br>- Have a shorter lifespan than nickel metal hydride.<br>- Are not heat sensitive like nickel cadmium.<br>- Cannot be overcharged.<br>- Are more expensive than nickel cadmium or nickel metal hydride.|

Lithium-ion batteries suffered from swelling and catching fire. Should the battery swell, stop using the device and replace the battery. If the battery catches fire, do not use water to extinguish the flames; lithium reacts violently with water. If available, use a class D fire extinguisher

## 12.6 Mobile Device Security | Slide 195 | 40mins
### Facts
Mobile devices are used for making phone calls, managing bank accounts, and everything in between. As such, they pose a unique security threat. A single smartphone sometimes contains more personal information than a desktop computer. All that information is on a device that can be easily lost or stolen.

The following table lists methods for securing a mobile device:

|Security Method|Description|
|---|---|
|Screen locks|To secure access to a mobile device, configure the device's lock screen to use some sort of authentication. Lock screen authentication methods include:<br><br>- Swipe lock. Most mobile devices are configured to use a swipe lock screen. This means that anyone can unlock the device with a simple swipe of the screen (there's no authentication at all). For obvious reasons, this is not very secure.<br>- Biometric locks. The two most common biometric locks are fingerprint and facial recognition. With fingerprint recognition, the user's finger is scanned and used to unlock the device. With facial recognition, the device's camera is used to scan the user's face and unlock the device.<br>- PIN. A PIN allows a user to enter the correct four or six numbers to unlock the mobile device.<br>- Pattern unlock. Pattern unlock allows the user to create a line pattern on a nine-point grid to unlock a mobile device.<br>- Passcode. Passcode authentication requires a user-defined password to unlock the device. The password can be a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.|
|Near-field scanner features|Data can be transferred from device-to-device using a very low power and short distance connection. The distance between devices is generally less than an inch. It is often used with credit card machines as tap and go.|
|Biometric authentication|Biometric authentication is a type of authentication that relies on the unique physical characteristics of individuals to verify identity. Some mobile devices support biometric authentication on lock screens.  <br>  <br>The two most common ones are fingerprint and facial recognition.|
|Multifactor authentication|Multifactor authentication is a type of authentication that requires multiple authentication credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction.  <br>  <br>For example, you might require a user to enter a username, password, pin, and fingerprint before authenticating to a computer system.|
|Failed login attempts|Most mobile devices are configured by default to allow only a set number of failed login attempts (usually ten). If more than ten failed logins are attempted, the mobile device will automatically wipe the entire contents of the device and reset it to the factory defaults.<br><br>It's important to make sure that this feature is enabled on all mobile devices. This is one of the best lines of defense you can provide to a mobile device. Even if the passcode or PIN isn't very secure, it will be difficult for someone to guess the right one in only ten attempts.|
|Device encryption|Encryption is another line of defense you can implement. It is set by default on most new devices. Encryption makes the stored information unreadable without decryption. This means even if someone was able to copy the contents of the device, the encrypted data wouldn't be usable.  <br>  <br>There are two types of encryption methods used by mobile devices:<br><br>- Partial device encryption. With this method, only the sections of the device's storage that contain files are encrypted. This type of encryption is fast, but it doesn't encrypt deleted files, which can be recovered using special software.<br>- Full device encryption. This method encrypts every sector of the device's storage, whether it has data or not. This protects the entire device, including deleted files. If a mobile device doesn't encrypt contents by default, it's important to make sure that full device encryption is enabled and configured.|
|Remote wipe|Remote wipe remotely formats a mobile device. It's a feature that's built into a lot of mobile devices, especially smart phones. Third-party software (such as Windows Intune and other mobile device management (MDM) software) is also available.  <br>  <br>Remote wipe requires a connection to the device. This means that in order to send a remote wipe command, the device needs to be powered on and have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.|
|Device locator|Many smart phones and tablets have a device location feature to locate a lost or stolen device. This feature is usually a proprietary service specific to the device manufacturer; however, there are also third-party apps that offer location services.  <br>  <br>If the service has been set up on a device, the owner can use a website or software application to identify the approximate location of the device on a map. The service can also tell the device to take a picture with both the front and back cameras, then send the pictures to you. This can further help identify the device's exact location.|
|Remote backup applications|Remote backup applications allow you to recover important business data and personal files (e.g., pictures and texts) from a lost, stolen, or broken phone. Most cellular providers offer some type of cloud backup service. In addition, each mobile OS offers its own proprietary backup service:<br><br>- iOS devices have two backup tools:<br>    - The desktop application iTunes can backup and restore iOS devices. iTunes requires mobile devices to be connected to the desktop computer via a USB cable.<br>    - The iCloud service can backup and synchronize files and settings across all Apple devices (i.e., mobile and desktop devices).<br>        - iCloud is a cloud-based backup service and requires an Apple ID, which must be logged into and configured on each Apple device.<br>        - The iCloud service synchronizes and backs up files on Apple devices over the internet.<br>- Android devices use the Google sync service to sync and backup mail, contacts, calendar, and files across all android devices. Google sync is a cloud-based service and requires a Google account.<br>- Windows Mobile devices have two backup tools:<br>    - OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud-based backup service and requires a Microsoft account.<br>    - Windows Mobile devices can also be backed up using a desktop computer with the Windows OS installed.<br>        <br>        There are several third-party backup solutions that provide similar and enhanced features|
|Authenticator applications|An authenticator application is a specialized app called an authenticator. You pre-set the app to work with the service and provide a constantly rotating set of codes for two-factor authentication. The codes in authenticator apps sync across accounts and provide an extra layer of security.  <br>  <br>For example, implementing two-factor authentication on a Gmail account a requires a username, password and one of the generated codes from the authenticator app to log in to the Gmail account. It may take a little longer to log in, but it provides an added layer of security.|
|OS updates and patches|Operating system updates often fix security vulnerabilities. Because hackers are constantly trying to find new ways to exploit technologies, keeping a device's operating system up to date is very important.  <br>  <br>The way a device receives an update depends on the type of mobile device, the manufacturer, and (if it's a smart phone) the cellular carrier.|
|Trusted vs. untrusted apps|Applications for mobile devices can be placed into two categories: trusted and untrusted.<br><br>- Trusted apps are those that have been reviewed and approved by the device's app service.<br>    - When approved, the app is signed with a certificate that identifies it as a trusted app.<br>    - For the most part, this means the app is safe to install and does not contain malicious code.<br>- Untrusted apps are those that have not been verified and approved by the app service.<br>    - While it's possible that an untrusted app is safe, it's very risky to install one.<br>    - By default, most devices won't install untrusted apps.<br>Software for mobile devices should be restricted to trusted app stores such as Google Play, the Microsoft Store, or Apple App Store.|
|Antivirus and anti-malware|It is a good idea to install an anti-malware app on mobile devices, especially devices that are used by an organization or connect to a company network. This will protect the device from malicious email attachments, downloads, or applications. It will also help prevent the spread of viruses onto a network.|
|Firewalls|A firewall inspects network traffic and allows or blocks traffic based on a set of rules. It can be a powerful tool to help protect a device.|
|Unauthorized Access|Because smart phones connect to so many networks, it is possible for an unauthorized person to access data, location, camera, microphone, and mobile device account information. Implementing basic security practices (e.g., locking the phone with a strong password) can help protect against unauthorized access. There are several things you can do to mitigate this risk:<br><br>- Data. Mobile phones are computers that contain financial, personal, or sensitive information. Be aware that:<br>    - A phone's portability makes it vulnerable to being easily lost or stolen. Be sure to use a lock screen with strong authentication.<br>    - Hackers can access data on a phone using the same methods they use for desktop and laptop computers. Anti-malware and training in detecting social engineering can help protect against hackers.<br>    - Many social media applications allow third-party app developers to collect and sell information about users. Review privacy practices of social media applications and restrict collection and sale of information.<br>- Account. Share mobile device account information only with authorized vendors and people who share the mobile device plan.<br>    - Carefully select who to share a mobile phone plan with.<br>    - If you suspect a plan provider's employee has accessed an account without authorization, contact the provider and explain the concerns as soon as possible.<br>- Location. A cell phone's GPS tracking feature makes a user vulnerable to unauthorized location tracking.<br>    - To mitigate this risk, turn the GPS location feature off when you aren't using GPS navigation.<br>    - Also carefully select the apps that you allow to track location. Many apps that request location tracking don't need it to perform the function they provide.<br>- Camera and microphone. Be aware that:<br>    - Many apps that request access to a camera and microphone don't need those features to function. Grant access only when necessary for the app's function.<br>    - If a phone's camera and microphone are hacked, all visual and auditory data the phone collects is accessible to the hacker.|
|Prevent unintended connections|Some mobile devices are configured to automatically connect to open Wi-Fi networks or accept other types of wireless connections (e.g., Bluetooth). This presents a serious security threat. For example, if a mobile device were to connect to an AP owned by a malicious individual, any information sent by the device can be captured and used.<br><br>- To prevent against unintended Wi-Fi connections:<br>    - Configure Wi-Fi settings to always ask for permission to connect to unknown wireless networks.<br>    - If Wi-Fi is not being used, consider turning off the Wi-Fi adapter.<br>    - If a mobile device has already connected to an unknown wireless network, remove the network from the saved networks list in order to prevent future connections.<br>- To prevent against unintended Bluetooth pairing:<br>    - Turn off Bluetooth unless it is actively being used. This not only prevents Bluetooth pairing and discovery, it also increases the device's battery life.<br>    - Delete (unpair) a device that has been accidentally paired to a mobile device. Navigate to Bluetooth settings to see what devices are paired and unpair unwanted devices.|
|Policies and procedures|Policies and procedures to secure your mobile devices.<br><br>- BYOD vs. corporate owned. Some organizations implement security policies that forbid users from connecting personal mobile devices to the organizational network (wired or wireless). Some organizations allow mobile devices; they may even provide users with mobile devices.<br>    - There is a risk that company data on a device could be compromised if a device is lost, stolen, or hacked.<br>    - As a safeguard, many organizations require remote wipe to be enabled on the device so that if it is lost, stolen, or hacked, a command can be sent remotely to the device to remove all data on it.<br>- Profile security requirements. Utilize an Acceptable Use Policy to specify how users:<br>    - Connect personally owned mobile devices to the organization's wireless network. The policy may also specify rules for internet sites that can be accessed using those devices.<br>    - Use company-owned computers for personal use, such as shopping for personal items on ecommerce websites.|
|Internet of Things (IoT)|The Internet of Things defines a body of devices that utilize the internet or other communication networks to exchange data with other devices and systems. It is an integration of technology and communications to provide monitoring, connectivity, and configuration. Examples include wearable technology and home automation.|
|Device management|In addition to policies, mobile devices can be secured by using special mobile device management tools that allow for remote management of multiple mobile devices. Using an MDM tool, an IT administrator can:<br><br>- Test configuration settings before deploying them.<br>- Create and enforce mobile device security policies.<br>- Remotely wipe mobile devices.<br>- Push OS updates to devices.<br><br>The specific MDM you use depends on the mobile device's operating system.<br><br>- iOS devices use the Apple Configurator tool.<br>- Windows Mobile devices use the Microsoft Intune tool, a cloud-based mobile management app.<br>- Android devices can be managed using a variety of free, subscription or fee-based third-party MDM tools, including the Microsoft Intune tool.|

## 12.7 Laptop & Mobile Device Troubleshooting | Slide 212 | 56Mins
### Laptop Maintenance facts
Mobile device integration into the workspace requires that you have the knowledge and skills to perform maintenance on them and provide users with preventative maintenance tips. This lesson provides important concepts for working with mobile devices.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Mobile device assembly
- External components care
- Cooling
- Transporting mobile devices

**Mobile Device Assembly**
When assembling and disassembling mobile devices keep in mind:

- Most laptop manufacturers provide service manuals on their websites. You can use the service manuals to learn disassembly/reassembly procedures for the laptop makes and models you work with.
- The components used in laptop systems are much smaller than those used in desktop system. You should carefully organize and label each part as you remove it from the system to ensure that it doesn't get lost and that it gets reinstalled in the correct location.
- Liquid spills are especially damaging to a portable device. Liquid can easily run beneath the keyboard and onto internal components. Keep food and drink away from devices.

**External Components Care**
It's important to take care of the external parts of devices. Keep the following tips in mind.

- If individual keys on a keyboard stick, you might be able to remove the sticking keys and clean underneath them. If that does not work, you need to replace the keyboard.
- You should clean the display with a lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcohol. Spray the alcohol on the cloth, not directly on the screen, to avoid getting it on other components.

**Cooling**
Cooling is a major concern for portable devices. Follow these recommendations:

- Keep all air vents clear and unobstructed. Vents are typically located on the back of the unit.
- Do not place a laptop on a surface where air can't circulate beneath it evenly. This will with help heat dissipation.
- Consider purchasing special laptop cooling bases that provide fans for the bottom of the unit. A cooling base is the best way to keep a laptop properly ventilated.
- Set laptops on top of a hard, solid surface, such as a desk or countertop. Do this when a laptop cooling base is not available.
- Avoid soft surfaces, such as a couch or your lap. These surfaces can obstruct even air flow.
- Adjust processor throttling (if supported) and configure Power Options to reduce power consumption. Lower power consumption not only saves battery life, it lowers heat output.

**Transporting Mobile Devices**
Transporting a mobile device without careful attention can cause damage to or loss of the device. To avoid unnecessary repair or replacement, follow these guidelines:

- When moving from outside to inside, allow the computer to warm up before using it. This will help prevent water vapor condensation when it warms up quickly.
- You should avoid leaving portable devices in cars where the temperature can reach extremes or where direct sunlight is magnified.
- Although they are built to withstand being moved, protect portable devices in properly padded cases; use proper packaging materials when shipping them.
- When installed, both PCMCIA and ExpressCard cards extend past the outer edge of the laptop. Remove the cards from the slots before putting them in a case to protect them from damage.


### Battery Recalibration Facts
Battery power meters in laptops commonly report the incorrect amount of charge remaining in the battery. Typically, the power meter reports less available power than the battery has. This becomes a problem because Windows Power Schemes use the power meter to automatically turn off the laptop when the battery level reaches a certain level (such as 5% remaining). The system may shut down even when there is sufficient battery power remaining.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Calibrate the battery
- Calibration tips

**Calibrate the battery**
Calibration synchronizes the power meter to the charge capacity of the battery. Many laptops come with a software tool for calibrating the battery; some include a function in the BIOS. If the laptop does not include a calibration tool, you can calibrate the battery by following these steps:

1. Charge the battery to 100%. Because you might not be able to trust the power meter shown in Windows, allow sufficient charging time.
2. In Windows, change the Power Scheme settings so the system is not shut down automatically when the battery level reaches a low level.
3. Unplug the laptop and run it only on battery power.
4. When the battery level drops below 3%, turn the laptop off.
5. Connect the laptop to a power source and fully charge the battery.
6. Restart the computer and restore the previous Power Scheme settings.

**Calibration Tips**
Be aware of the following when working with laptop batteries.

- Some manufacturers recommend calibrating the battery when you first use it and every 3 months thereafter.
- Extreme high or low temperatures shorten the battery life.
- To provide more working time when running on battery power, turn down the display brightness, avoid watching DVDs, avoid playing CDs, turn off wireless networking when not in use, use Power Scheme settings to power off unused devices, and adjust processor power settings (if available).
- If the battery will go unused for longer than 2 weeks (for example, if you are not using the laptop or are running it only on AC power) remove the battery and store it separately.
- Storing a battery longer than 3 months without use might affect its ability to hold a charge.
- Depending on how you use them, most batteries will last between 1-3 years. Under normal conditions, the battery will gradually lose capacity over time. If the battery life is still low after calibration, the only solution is to replace the battery.

### Laptop Troubleshooting Facts
Due to the integrated nature of laptops, troubleshooting laptop components is significantly harder than troubleshooting desktop components. Most laptop manufacturers provide service manuals on their websites. You can use these service manuals to learn specific troubleshooting procedures for a particular make and model.

This lesson covers troubleshooting guidelines.

**Troubleshooting Guidelines**
The following table provides troubleshooting guidelines to follow when working with laptop computers.

|Component|Troubleshooting Tips|
|---|---|
|Power|Laptops can run on AC power from the power adapter or battery power. When troubleshooting power, verify that:<br><br>- The cord from the AC outlet to the power adapter is correctly connected to both the wall and the adapter. Move it around to see if you can make a secure connection.<br>- The LED light on the power adapter is lit. If it isn't lit, the point of failure is between the outlet and the adapter.<br>- The battery is sufficiently charged. If the battery reads fully charged in Windows, disconnect the laptop from its power source. If the battery lasts only a short amount of time, replace the battery.<br>- If the computer runs for only a short time even while plugged in, it could be that the power adapter is bad. If the adapter is not working, the computer will run off of the battery until the battery is drained. Try using a different adapter or verify the power coming from the adapter.<br>- If the battery seems to be losing the ability to hold a charge, or if the power drops shortly after starting to use the laptop, try recalibrating the battery.<br>- If the device starts to show signs of distortion, bulging, or wobbling, the battery may be swollen. Possible causes are the battery is too old, or was exposed to too much heat and humidity. You must replace a swollen battery.|
|Video|If the laptop has no display at all:<br><br>- You can press Function (Fn) and the appropriate display key to switch the display output to the laptop monitor.<br>- If the built-in monitor isn't working, connect an external monitor to the laptop. Use the Fn keys to direct output to the external monitor.<br>- If you don't get a display on either monitor, you likely have a problem with the video card. Repairing the video card typically means replacing the motherboard.<br>- If the display renders on the external monitor but doesn't render on the laptop, there is likely a problem with the LCD display. If this is the case, you should verify:<br>    - The LCD cutoff switch is working. Sometimes the switch can get stuck in the off position, preventing the output from going to the LCD.<br>    - There aren't cracks in the bezel around the LCD. Bezel cracks can be an indicator that the LCD has been damaged.<br>    - The power bundles that go from the laptop to the LCD are not damaged or cracked. Remove the bezel around the LCD to inspect the power bundles.<br><br>Additional problems with laptop displays include:<br><br>- Dead Spots—areas on the screen (sometimes entire rows or columns of pixels) that no longer work. This means that the LCD assembly is no longer functioning and you need to replace it. Be aware that it is often cheaper to purchase a new laptop computer than to replace the display.<br>- Bad backlight—may cause a display to become dim. It is important to note that dimming the backlight is a power saving method used by laptop computers. Always verify that the screen isn't dimmed before replacing the backlight.<br>- Flickering Screen—can be caused by a faulty backlight or inverter. Replacement parts can be purchased from the laptop's manufacturer.<br><br>If you know that the LCD needs to be replaced but you don't have the resources to buy a new LCD or a new laptop, consider converting the laptop into a desktop system by connecting it to an external monitor permanently. If the video card is bad, try using a remote solution (such as Remote Desktop) to connect to the laptop from an external system.|
|Applications|If you cannot load an app from the Microsoft Store, use the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter to search for and correct problems. Third-party apps have varying levels of support. You may have to contact the developer to troubleshoot issues.  <br>  <br>If you are unable to decrypt an email, you probably don't have the correct private key. You must import it from another computer.  <br>  <br>If the GPS is not functioning:<br><br>- Begin troubleshooting by running the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter program.<br>- Update Bluetooth drivers if you have trouble pairing a GPS-dependent Bluetooth device.<br>- Install the drivers in Compatibility mode for the correct Windows version if the pairing device uses Window 7 or older.<br>- Use known good devices to check for damaged hardware and replace components as necessary.|
|Laptop Components|The most common portable components used with laptop systems are keyboards, mice, digitizer pads, and antennae. The following list suggests troubleshooting methods to use when working with these components:<br><br>- You can test a bad keyboard by plugging an external keyboard to the laptop. If it works, the laptop keyboard is malfunctioning and needs to be replaced.<br>- Most laptop systems have features that cause keyboard keys to perform alternate functions (such as NUM LOCK emulating 10-key functionality). Before troubleshooting other problems, make sure that special features that can cause keys to perform alternate tasks are not enabled.<br>- Some power saving modes don't support indicator light function. Also, the NUM LOCK indicator lights may not correspond to the NUM LOCK's function state.<br>    - You can press the F LOCK key with the NUM LOCK key to see if it responds.<br>    - If it doesn't respond, the computer probably isn't properly maintaining the NUM LOCK state and may have damaged components.<br>- Mouse malfunction on a laptop is usually caused by the installation of an incorrect driver. Good indicators that the incorrect driver has been installed are:<br>    - The laptop mouse's sensitivity isn't consistent.<br>    - The mouse doesn't recognize a double tap.<br>- A digitizer pad in laptop and PDA systems receives input. Input is written onto the pad with a stylus pen. Those motions are translated into data that is processed by the system. If the pad becomes scratched, the laptop or PDA cannot receive input correctly.<br>    - This is most easily resolved by buying a cleaning product named Screen Clean. It removes the top layer of plastic from the digitizer pad, thus removing existing scratches and giving the pad a fresh surface.<br>    - You will need to replace the digitizer pad or buy a new system if the scratch is too deep.<br>- Digitizer pads can have an issue called pointer drift (also known as ghost cursor).<br>    - Drift occurs when a pad's pressure sensors need to be realigned.<br>    - Recalibrating the digitizer pad can fix this issue.<br>    - It is best to recalibrate before it progresses to the point that you can't access the recalibration utility.<br>- Though laptop antennae are supposed to be omni-directional, they sometimes need to be re-oriented to get the best reception.<br>    - This can usually be done by moving the laptop until the reception improves.<br>    - If redirecting the antennae doesn't work and wireless reception is consistently poor, the antennae may need to be replaced.<br>- Many laptops include a switch that turns the wireless network card on and off. When troubleshooting wireless network connectivity, make sure the switch is turned on.<br>- If the speakers are not producing sound, try the following in this order:<br>    - Verify the volume is turned all the way up and the speakers or headphones are connected correctly.<br>    - Make sure the sound card works properly and is running with updated drivers.<br>    - Run the Windows Audio Troubleshooter program.<br>    - Consider that the hardware components are damaged and need to be replaced.<br>- If the external components are not connecting to the device and you've checked that they are working on a known good device, the laptop may have malfunctioning ports.<br>    - If it's a software issue, reinstalling the driver should fix the problem.<br>    - If the problem persists, it's likely hardware-related and one or more ports have been physically damaged. In this case the most probable solution is to replace the motherboard.<br><br>As long as the laptop runs, you can substitute an external device connected to a PS/2, USB, PCMCIA, or ExpressCard slot for most failed components. This will allow you to continue using the computer.|

### Mobile Device Troubleshooting
Mobile devices present a unique challenge for troubleshooting. Their mobile nature makes them prone to a variety of problems that can manifest in various ways.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Troubleshooting tools
- Common mobile issues

**Troubleshooting Tools**
You can use the following tools to help troubleshoot mobile devices.

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|App scanner|An app scanner is a tool that can identify problems with installed apps.<br><br>- When installed, the app scans all installed apps on the mobile device and uses a definitions list to identify any issues.<br>- You can configure an app scanner to automatically scan the mobile device on a specified schedule.<br><br>Because app scanners use a definitions list to identify problems, it is important to always keep the list up to date.|
|Wi-Fi analyzer|Wi-Fi analyzers are special apps you can use to troubleshoot Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Most Wi-Fi analyzer apps provide the following functionality:<br><br>- Identify the number of wireless access points (WAPs) that are broadcasting.<br>- Display the signal strength and channel of each wireless network.<br>- Obtain wireless network information (e.g., signal band, SSID, security mode, etc.).|
|Cell tower analyzer|You can use a cell tower analyzer to troubleshoot cellular network connectivity by displaying the following information:<br><br>- Signal strength/interference.<br>- Number of cell towers in the area.<br>- The location of each cell tower.<br>- Mobile network information (e.g., network type, data activity, service provider, etc.).|

**Common Mobile Issues**
The following table describes the most common mobile issues and the actions you can take to identify and fix the problem.

|Issue|Description|
|---|---|
|No display|A mobile device's display can stop working for a several reasons. If you are troubleshooting a mobile device with a display issue, take the following actions.<br><br>- Verify the device is fully charged and powered on. It is possible that the device is powered off or the battery is drained.<br>- Check the device's brightness level. If the brightness level is too low, it may appear as though the display is off. Look at the screen in a dark room to make sure this isn't the case.<br>- Find out if the device was dropped. When a mobile device is dropped, it is possible for the screen to be damaged, even if there is no visible physical damage.<br>- Look for physical damage. If the screen is cracked or the device has physical damage, the display is most likely broken and needs to be replaced.<br>- If the device is displaying but won't cast to an external device (e.g., a television), make sure both devices:<br>    - Are using updated software versions<br>    - Have permission to connect to other devices<br>    - Are paired correctly<br>    - Use online forums to search the symptoms and find solutions for the specific devices. Or contact the device's manufacturer for support.|
|Non-responsive touchscreen|Mobile devices use capacitive touchscreens that require a conductive material touching the screen to work. If the touchscreen is not functioning or is inaccurate, you should:<br><br>- Look for liquid on the screen. Because water is conductive, any type of moisture on the screen will result in erratic touchscreen behavior.<br>- Check for cracks or physical damage. A cracked screen can disrupt the current flow across the screen and cause specific sections of the touchscreen to fail.<br>- Make sure the screen is calibrated. You can calibrate it using the device's built-in calibration app.|
|Unauthorized access|Mobile devices are vulnerable to many of the same attacks that target desktop systems. One such attack is unauthorized access, where an attacker gains access to a specific feature or functionality of the mobile device.<br><br>- Unauthorized account access occurs when an attacker obtains the login credentials for a cloud backup service or the device itself. This can result in leaked personal files and data. To protect against this:<br>    - Use some authentication on the mobile device.<br>    - Use complex passwords.<br>    - Set up two-factor authentication with all accounts that contain sensitive information.<br>- Unauthorized root access is typically the result of a virus or malicious program installed on the mobile device. With root access, the malicious program can make low-level system changes to the mobile device, including modifying root certificates. To protect against unintended root access:<br>    - Install a anti-malware app on the mobile device.<br>    - Keep it up to date.<br>- Unauthorized location tracking occurs when the GPS on the device is being used to track the user's location without permission. To protect against this:<br>    - Review the device's security settings.<br>    - Identify the installed apps that have access to location services.<br>    - Modify the permissions to deny location tracking access for those app's that you don't want to track the user.<br>- Unauthorized camera/microphone activation is the use of the device's camera or microphone without the user's permission. This can be caused by a malicious program, a malicious individual, or an installed application that has been granted permission to use these services.<br>- Most mobile devices have an LED or icon that indicates if the camera is being used. If a camera is being used without permission:<br>    <br>    - Review the device's security settings and app permission settings.<br>    - Install an anti-malware app and run a scan on the device to remove any malicious apps.<br>    <br>    If you become locked out of your phone, you can always get back in by performing a factory reset, but note that this will remove all data from your device.|
|Weak or no signal|Most connectivity issues are a result of a weak signal or some sort of interference.<br><br>- If the device is having problems connecting to a wireless network:<br>    - Verify the wireless adapter is turned on.<br>    - Verify that the wireless configuration settings are correct.<br>    - Use a Wi-Fi analyzer to identify the network's signal strength as well as interference sources (e.g., other network signals).<br>    - Verify that the data limit data limit hasn't been exceeded and data access is being denied by the provider.<br>- If the device is having problems with cellular service:<br>    - Make sure the mobile device has a SIM card installed.<br>    - Use a cell tower analyzer to identify network coverage, signal strength, and network type (i.e., 1x, 3G, 4G).<br>    - Verify that the data limit data limit hasn't been exceeded and data access is being denied by the provider.|
|Slow performance|If the device seems to be running slow, actions to identify the problem include:<br><br>- Identify system resources and usage. Many mobile devices have a system monitor you can use to identify the apps using system resources (i.e., memory, processor, etc.).<br>- Make sure the apps being used are compatible with the mobile device. Older mobile devices have slower processors and might not be able to run all the latest mobile apps available to it.<br>- Check the amount of free storage on the mobile device. If a mobile device's storage is more than 80% full, performance can be reduced considerably.<br>- Turn off an overheating phone and place it in a cool place out of direct sunlight. Overheating can damage hardware, but cooling the device can correct issues. Avoid overheating by keeping the phone out of direct sunlight and extremely hot places, such as a car parked in direct sunlight.<br>- Troubleshoot speakers not performing correctly, by checking the sound settings.<br>    <br>    - Make sure nothing is set to Mute, Vibrate, Do not Disturb, or Silent.<br>    - Make sure the phone isn't connected to another device with Bluetooth.<br>    - If speakers still aren't working, plug headphones into the device. If you can hear sound through the headphones but not through the device's speakers, you may have a hardware issue.<br>    <br>    - Turn the phone off and back on again.<br>    - Contact phone's manufacturer or the cell service provider for support if the you can't resolve the issue.<br>- If the GPS isn't functioning:<br>    - Verify the phone is receiving a clear signal. You need a clear signal for the GPS to work and to troubleshoot any GPS problems.<br>    - Verify the location permissions are enabled for the app you are trying to use.<br>    - Refresh location services by turning the **Location** function on and off or putting the phone in Airplane mode for a few moments.<br>    - If these solutions don't work, you may have to reset all the location and network data, or restore the device's factory settings.<br>- Review security and performance logs on a phone. This can help you troubleshoot performance issues.<br>    - Review materials from the device manufacturer to learn how review logs on the phone.<br>    - Be aware that you may have to connect the phone to a computer with a USB.|
