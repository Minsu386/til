# Ram Types

The CPU works by processing the instructions generated by software (processes) in a pipeline. Instructions that are at the top of the pipeline are stored in the CPU’s registers and cache. The CPU only has a small amount of cache. We add more support with RAM

System memory is implemented as random-access memory (RAM) devices. RAM is faster than the flash memory used for SSDs and much faster than an HDD, but it is volatile. Volatile means that the memory device can only store data when it is powered on.

System memory is measure in gigabytes (GB). The amount of system RAM determines the PC’s ability to work with multiple applications at the same time and to process large files efficiently.
## Virtual RAM
If there is not enough system RAM, the memory space can be extended by using disk storage. This is referred to as a pagefile or swap space. The total amount of addressable memory (system RAM plus swap space) is referred to as virtual memory or **virtual RAM**. With virtual memory, the OS assigns memory locations to processes in 4 kilobyte chunks called pages. The memory controller moves inactive pages of memory to the swap space to free up physical RAM and retrieves pages from the swap space to physical RAM when required by process execution. An excessive amount of such paging activity will slow the computer down because disk transfer rates are slower than RAM transfer rates.\

*Virtual memory is not just used to supplement RAM with swap space. It serves an important function in protecting the operation and integrity of the PC. Multiple processes can share the RAM device resource as a virtual memory space that is mediated by the operating system. This is more secure and reliable than allowing each process to use physical RAM devices.*


## Memory Modules

DDR for desktop system memory is packaged in a form factor called dual inline memory module (DIMM). The notches (keys) on the module’s edge connector identify the DDR generation (DDR3/DDR4/DDR5) and prevent it from being inserted into an incompatible slot or inserted the wrong way around. DDR DIMMs typically feature heat sinks, due to the use of high clock speeds.

## DDR

DDR memory modules are labeled using the maximum theoretical bandwidth, such as PC1600, PC2100, and so on. As an example of how this value is derived, consider DDR-200 PC-1600 memory:

The internal memory device clock speed and memory bus speed (between the memory devices and memory controller) are both 100 MHz.
The data rate is double this as there are two operations per clock "tick." This is expressed in units called megatransfers per second (200 MT/s). This gives the DDR-200 designation.
The peak transfer rate is 1600 MBps (200 MT/s multiplied by 8 bytes (64 bits) per transfer). This gives the "PC-1600" designation. 1600 MBps is equivalent to 1.6 GBps.
Subsequent generations of DDR technology—DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5—increase bandwidth by multiplying the bus speed, as opposed to the speed at which the actual memory devices work. This produces scalable speed improvements without making the memory modules too unreliable or too hot. Design improvements also increase the maximum possible capacity of each memory module.

## Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM

is used for workstations and servers that require a high level of reliability.

For each transfer, ECC RAM performs a hash calculation on the data value and stores it as an 8-bit checksum. This checksum requires an extra processor chip on the module and a 72-bit data bus rather than the regular 64 bits. The memory controller performs the same calculation and should derive the same checksum. This system can detect and correct single-bit errors and allow the PC to continue functioning normally. ECC can also detect errors of 2, 3, or 4 bits but cannot correct them. Instead, it will generate an error message and halt the system.

Most types of ECC are supplied as registered DIMMs (RDIMMs). A registered DIMM uses an extra component to reduce electrical load on the memory controller. This has a slight performance penalty, but makes the system more reliable, especially if large amounts of memory are installed. Most types of non-ECC memory are unbuffered DIMMs (UDIMMs). Some types of ECC RAM are packaged in UDIMMs, though this is rarer.

All these factors must be considered when selecting memory for a system:

- Both the motherboard and CPU must support ECC operation for it to be enabled.
- Most motherboards support either UDIMMs or RDIMMs, but not both.
- If a motherboard does support both, UDIMM and RDIMM modules cannot be mixed on the same motherboard. The system will not boot if there are different types.
- Mixing non-ECC UDIMMs and ECC UDIMMs is unlikely to work.


## Memory Channel

**Single-channel** memory means that there is one 64-bit data bus between the CPU, memory controller, and RAM devices. With a **dual-channel** memory controller, there are effectively two 64-bit pathways through the bus to the CPU, meaning that 128 bits of data can be sent per transfer rather than 64 bits. This feature requires support from the CPU, memory controller, and motherboard but not from the RAM devices. Ordinary RAM modules are used. There are no "dual-channel" DDR memory modules.


When configuring a dual-channel system, you will need to consult the system documentation to identify the appropriate slots to use. As a generic example, a dual-channel motherboard might have four DIMM slots arranged in color-coded pairs. Each pair represents one channel. For example, channel A might be color-coded orange and channel B color-coded blue. Each slot in a pair represents one of the two sockets in the channel (A1 and A2, for instance).

Depending on the motherboard and firmware settings, adding an odd number of modules or adding DIMMs that are not the same clock speed and size will have different outcomes. A configuration with mismatched modules may cause the system to operate in single-channel mode, in a dual-channel mode with the spare module disabled, or in flex mode. Flex mode means that if A1 contains a 2 GB module and B1 contains a 6 GB module, dual-channel mode will be enabled for 2 GB of memory and the remaining 4 GB from the module in B1 will work in single-channel mode.

Some CPUs and supporting chipsets have **triple-** or **quadruple-channel** memory controllers. In these architectures, if the full complement of modules is not installed, the system will revert to as many channels as are populated.
