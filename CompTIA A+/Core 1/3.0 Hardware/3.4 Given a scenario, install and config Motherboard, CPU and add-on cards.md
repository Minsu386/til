# Motherboard
----
All computer software and data are processed by using the ones and zeroes of binary code. Software works by running instructions in the central processing unit (CPU). This can be referred to as the compute or processing function of a PC.

Instructions and data also require storage. The CPU can only store a limited number of instructions internally at any one time. Additional storage for running programs and open data files is provided through system memory. This random-access memory (RAM) storage technology is nonpersistent. _Nonpersistent_ means that the RAM devices can only hold data when the PC is powered on. Mass storage devices are used to preserve data when the computer is turned off.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230924095746.png)
These processing and storage components are connected by bus interfaces implemented on the motherboard. The instructions and data are stored using transistors and capacitors and transmitted between components over the bus using electrical signals.

The motherboard’s system clock synchronizes the operation of all parts of the PC and provides the basic timing signal for the CPU. Clock speeds are measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). Clock multipliers take the timing signal produced by the generator and apply a multiplication factor to produce different timing signals for different types of buses. This means that one type of bus can work at a different speed (or frequency) to another type of bus.

The type of motherboard influences system speed and the range of system devices and adapter cards that can be installed or upgraded. There are many motherboard manufacturers, including AOpen (Acer), ASRock, ASUSTek, Biostar, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte, Intel, and MSI. Each motherboard is designed to support a particular range of CPUs. PC CPUs are principally manufactured by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).


# Motherboard Form Factors
----
The **motherboard form factor** describes its shape, layout, and the type of case and power supply that can be used, plus the number of adapter cards that can be installed.

## Advanced Technology eXtended Form Factor
----
The **Advanced Technology Extended (ATX)** specification is the standard form factor for most desktop PC motherboards and cases. Full-size ATX boards are 12 inches wide by 9.6 inches deep (or 305 mm x 244 mm). An ATX board can contain up to seven expansion slots.

The Micro-ATX (mATX) standard specifies a 9.6-inch (244 mm x 244 mm) square board. mATX boards can have a maximum of four expansion slots.

*Most mATX boards can be mounted in ATX cases*

## Information Technology eXtended Form Factor
----
Small form factor (SFF) PCs are popular as home machines and for use as mini servers. SFF PCs often use Via's Mini-ITX (**Information Technology Extended**) form factor.

Mini-ITX is 6.7 inches (170 mm x 170 mm) square with one expansion slot. These are designed for small cases, but do note that most mini-ITX boards can be mounted in ATX cases. There are also smaller nano-, pico-, and mobile-ITX form factors, but these are used for embedded systems and portables, rather than PCs.
*No commercial mobo were ever produced from the original plain ITX specs*

# Motherboard Installation
----

The motherboard is attached to the case by using standoffs. These hold the motherboard firmly and ensure no other part of it touches the case. The standoffs are positioned in holes that line up in the same position in the case and the motherboard if they use compatible form factors.

The general procedure for installing a motherboard is as follows:

1. Use the motherboard documentation to familiarize yourself with the specific installation procedure. Check whether any jumper clips need to be adjusted. A jumper is placed over header pins in a particular orientation. For example, there might be a jumper that enables recovery mode. *The Motherboard is vulnerable to ESD. Always take anti ESD precautions when handling and storing these devices*
2. Orient the board to the oblong I/O cut out at the rear of the case. Prepare the motherboard I/O blanking plate in the correct orientation by removing caps so that USB, audio, and video ports will be uncovered when the board is fitted. Fit the blanking plate to the case by snapping it into the cut out.
3. Insert standoffs into the case to match the hole locations on the motherboard. Standoffs are usually threaded, though older cases might use push-down pegs. There might be a guide standoff attached to the case or all standoffs might come preinstalled. Make sure that corners, long edges, and the center of the board will be supported. Do not add standoffs where there is no corresponding hole on the motherboard
4. Optionally, add the CPU and memory modules to the motherboard before installing the board in the case.
5. Check the alignment and standoff location again and verify that each standoff is secure. If everything is correct, place the motherboard on the standoffs.
	![](Pasted%20image%2020230924100947.png)
	*Align the bard with the I/O cut out (top left) and ensure that it is supported by standoffs at the edges and in the center.*
6.  Secure each standoff using the appropriate screw type. Make sure that the board is firm and stable, but do not overtighten the screws or you risk cracking the board.
7. To complete PC installation, add the power and disk devices to the case, install any add on adapter cards to the motherboard, and install the data and power connectors.

# Motherboard Connector Types
----
## PCI
----
Expansion slots accept plug-in adapter cards to extend the range of functions the computer can perform. There are two main types of expansion slot interface.

### Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) 
----
The **Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe)** bus is the mainstream interface for modern adapter cards. It uses point-to-point serial communications, meaning that each component can have a dedicated link to any other component.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230924102752.png)

Each point-to-point connection is referred to as a link. Each link can make use of one or more lanes. The raw transfer rate of each lane depends on the PCIe version supported. Transfer rates are measured in gigatransfers per second (GT/s). Throughput in GB/s is the rate achieved after loss through encoding is accounted for.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924102823.png)

Adapter slots with more lanes are physically longer. Each PCIe adapter card supports a specific number of lanes, typically x1, x4, x8, or x16. Ideally, the card should be plugged into a port that supports the same number of lanes. However, if insufficient slots are available, a card will fit in any port with an equal or greater number of lanes. This is referred to as up-plugging. For example, a x8 card will fit in a x8 or x16 socket. The card should work at x8 but in some circumstances may only work at x1.

It may also be possible to fit a longer card into a shorter slot, referred to as down-plugging, so long as the card is not obstructed by other features in the case.

*A slot may support a lower number of lanes than its physical size suggests. The number of lanes supported by each slot is indicated by a label on the motherboard. For example, a slot that is physically x16 but supports only x8 operation will be labelled x16/x8 or x16 @ x8.*

All PCIe versions are backwards-compatible. For example, you can connect a PCIe version 2 adapter to a version 4 motherboard or install a version 3 adapter into a version 2 motherboard. The bus works at the speed of the lowest version component.

PCIe can supply up to 75W to a graphics card via a dedicated graphics adapter slot and up to 25W over other slots. An extra 75W power can be supplied via a PCIe power connector.
### Peripheral Component Interconnect Interface (PCI)
----
Computers can support more than one expansion bus, often to support older technologies. **Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)** is a legacy bus type, having been superseded by PCI Express. PCIe is software compatible with PCI, meaning that PCI ports can be included on a PCIe motherboard to support legacy adapter cards, but PCI cards cannot be fitted into PCIe slots.

As with many legacy technologies, PCI uses parallel communications. Most types of PCI are 32-bit and work at 33.3 MHz, achieving a transfer rate of up to 133 MBps (that is, 32 bits divided by 8 to get 4 bytes, then multiplied by the clock rate of 33.3). The earliest PCI cards were designed for 5V signaling, but 3.3V and dual voltage cards became more prevalent. To prevent an incompatible PCI card from being inserted into a motherboard slot (for example, a 3.3V card in a 5V PCI slot), the keying for the three types of cards is different.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924102940.png)


## Headers and Power Connectors
----
### Headers
----
Components on the front and rear panels of the case connect to **headers** on the motherboard:

- **Power button (soft power)**—Sends a signal that can be interpreted by the OS as a command to shut down rather than switching the PC off. Holding down the power button for a few seconds will cut the power, however.
- **Drive (HDD) activity lights**—Show when an internal hard disk is being accessed.
- **Audio ports**—Allow speakers and/or headphones and a microphone to be connected to the computer.
- **USB ports**—Internal USB 2 connections are made via 9-pin headers, which accept up to two 4-pin port connections (the 9th pin is to orient the cable correctly). USB 3 headers use a 2x10 format and can be cabled to two ports.

When disassembling the system, you should make a diagram of the position and orientation of header connectors. If you do not have a diagram, you will have to refer to the motherboard documentation or go by any labels printed on the wires and headers. These are not always very easy to follow, however.

### Power Connectors
----
The motherboard also contains various connection points for the power supply and fans.

- The main P1 motherboard **power connector** is a distinctive 2-pin x 12-pin block with square pin receptacles.
- Fan connectors are 3- or 4-pin Molex KK format. There will be one for the CPU and one or more for the case fans and components such as memory and video adapters. 4-pin fan connectors support precise fan-speed control via a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal carried by the blue wire. 3-pin fans are controlled by varying the voltage.
-
*Fans with a 3-pin connector can usually be used with 4-pin headers, but the system may not be able to vary the fan speed (or may need special configuration to be able to do so). A fan with a 4-pin connector will usually work with a 3-pin header but will not be able to use PWM.*
## Storage Connectors
----
One or more fixed disks installed inside the PC case provide persistent storage for the operating system, software programs, and data files. Fixed disks use either solid state drive (SSD) or hard disk drive (HDD) technology.

### Serial Advanced Technology Attachment Interface
----
The motherboard will contain several Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) ports to connect one or more fixed drives. SATA can also be used to connect removable drives, such as tape drives and optical drives (DVD/Blu-ray). SATA devices are installed to a drive bay in the chassis and then connected to a data port via a cable and to the power supply via a SATA power or Molex connector.

### M.2 Interface
----
An SSD can be provisioned in an adapter card form factor. These often use an M.2 interface. An M.2 port is oriented horizontally. The adapter card is inserted at an angle and then pushed into place and secured with a screw. M.2 adapters can be different lengths (42 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, or 110 mm), so you should check that any given adapter will fit on your motherboard. Labels indicate the adapter sizes supported. M.2 supplies power over the bus, so there is no need for a separate power cable.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924103757.png)

### eSATA
----
There is also an external SATA (eSATA) standard for the attachment of external drives, with a 2 m (78 in.) cable. You must use an eSATA cable to connect to an external eSATA port; you cannot use an internal SATA cable. eSATAp is a nonstandard powered port used by some vendors that is compatible with both USB and SATA (with an eSATAp cable).

*The main drawback of eSATA compared to USB or Thunderbolt external drives is that power is not supplied over the cable. This is not so much of an issue for 3.5-inch drives, which require a separate power supply, but it limits the usefulness of eSATA for 2.5-inch portable drives.*



# Motherboard CPU Compatibility / feature
----

The nature of the current CPU market means that there is rapid turnover of 
models. Each vendor releases a CPU design with a number of architectural improvements and quite often with a new socket design. This is referred to as a CPU’s generation. In each generation, the manufacturer releases several models.

Motherboards are specific to either Intel or AMD CPUs. Typically, **motherboard compatibility** is limited to the same generation of CPUs. The CPU must be supported by both the physical form factor of the motherboard’s **CPU socket** and by the motherboard’s chipset. There are limited opportunities to upgrade the CPU model while keeping the same motherboard, and such upgrades rarely offer much value.

Within each generation, CPU brands and models target different market segments, such as desktop, server, and mobile.



## Desktop
----
**Desktop** is shorthand for a basic PC as used at home or in the office. The term _desktop_ derives from a time when computer cases were designed to sit horizontally on a desk, rather than the vertical tower or all-in-one configurations used today. The desktop segment covers a wide range of performance levels, from budget to gaming PC. These performance levels are reflected in the CPU manufacturer’s ranges, with multiple models of Intel Core (i3/i5/i7/i9) and AMD Ryzen (A and 1 up to 9) CPUs at price points ranging from tens of dollars (i3 or Ryzen 1 series) to thousands (Ryzen Threadripper Pro). Intel also uses its historic brands, such as Pentium and Celeron, to market budget chips.

Current Intel desktop socket designs include LGA 2011, LGA 1151, LGA 2066, LGA 1200, and LGA 1700. Most current AMD CPUs use the PGA form factor socket AM4.

## Workstations
----
The term _workstation_ can be used in the same way as desktop to refer to any type of business PC or network client. However, in the context of PC sales, most vendors use the term _workstation_ to mean a high-performance PC, such as one used for software development or graphics/video editing. Workstation-class PCs often use similar components to server-class computers.

## Servers
----
**Server**-class computers must manage more demanding workloads than most types of desktops and operate to greater reliability standards. Server motherboards are often **multi-socket**, meaning that multiple CPU packages can be installed. Each of these CPUs will have multiple cores and support for multithreading, giving the server the raw processing power it needs to service requests from hundreds or thousands of client systems.

Other features of server-class motherboards include support for tens of gigabytes of ECC RAM and additional levels and amounts of cache memory. There are dedicated CPU ranges for servers, such as Intel’s Xeon and AMD’s Epyc brands. These ranges are also usually tied to specific supporting motherboards. A motherboard for an Intel Xeon CPU is unlikely to be compatible with an Intel Core CPU.

Intel’s recent Xeon models use LGA 1150, LGA 1151, and LGA 2011 sockets. AMD’s Epyc CPU uses the LGA Socket SP3 form factor.

## Mobile
----

Smartphones, tablets, and laptops need to prioritize power and thermal efficiency plus weight over pure performance. Many **mobiles** use ARM-based CPUs for this reason, and both Intel and AMD have separate mobile CPU models within each generation of their platforms. Mobile CPUs tend to use different socket form factors to desktops. Many are soldered to the motherboard and not replaceable or upgradeable.





# Basic Input Output System (BIOS) / Unified Extensible Interface (UEFI) setting
----
The motherboard firmware provides a low-level interface for configuring PC devices. It verifies that the components required to run an operating system are present and working correctly and provisions a trusted environment for various security functions. You will often need to use the system setup program when troubleshooting to check or modify firmware settings.

## BIOS and UEFI
----
Firmware is specialized program code stored in flash memory. Firmware is distinct from software because it is very closely tied to the basic functions of a specific hardware device type and model. PC or system firmware provides low-level code to allow PC components installed on a particular motherboard to be initialized so that they can load the main operating system software.

For many years, the system firmware for a PC was a type called the **Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)**. BIOS only supports 32-bit operation and limited functionality. Newer motherboards may use a different kind of firmware called **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)**. UEFI provides support for 64-bit CPU operation at boot, a full GUI and mouse operation at boot, networking functionality at boot, and better boot security. A computer with UEFI may also support booting in a legacy BIOS mode.

System **settings** can be configured via the system firmware setup program. The system setup program is accessed via a keystroke during the power-on (boot) process, typically when the PC vendor’s logo is displayed. The key combination used will vary from system to system; typical examples are **Esc**, **Del**, **F1**, **F2**, **F10**, or **F12**.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112250.png)

*One issue with modern computers is that the boot process can be very quick. If this is the case, you can **Shift**-click the **Restart** button from the Windows logon screen to access UEFI boot options.*

You navigate a legacy BIOS setup program using the keyboard arrow keys. Pressing **Esc** generally returns to the previous screen. When closing setup, there will be an option to exit and discard changes or exit and save changes. Sometimes this is done with a key (**Esc** versus **F10**, for instance), but more often there is a prompt. There will also be an option for reloading the default settings in case you want to discard any customizations you have made.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112310.png)

UEFI setup programs use a graphical interface and have mouse support, though advanced menus may still require keyboard navigation.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112320.png)

## BIOS and Device Options
----
One of the most important parameters in system setup is the **boot options** sequence or boot device priority. This defines the order in which the system firmware searches devices for a boot manager.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112529.png)

Typical choices include:

- **Fixed disk (HDD or SSD)**—A SATA boot disk should generally be connected to the lowest numbered port, but it is usually possible to select the hard drive sequence if multiple fixed drives are installed. An SSD attached using SATA will be listed with SATA/AHCI devices; an SSD installed as a PCIe Add-in Card (AIC) or on the M.2 interface will be listed under NVMe.
- **Optical drive (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)**—If you are performing a repair install from optical media, you might need to make this device the highest priority.
- **USB**—Most modern systems can boot from a USB drive that has been formatted as a boot device. This option is often used for OS installs and repair utility boot disks that are too large to fit on optical media.
- **Network/PXE**—Uses the network adapter to obtain boot settings from a specially configured server.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112551.png)

### USB Permissions
----
As well as boot device configuration, there will be options for enabling/disabling and configuring controllers and adapters provided on the motherboard. This provides a way of enforcing **USB permissions**. On many systems, allowing the connection of USB devices is a security risk. The setup program might allow individual ports to be enabled or disabled.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112628.png)


### Fan Considerations

Most cooling **fans** can be controlled via system settings, typically under a menu such as Cooling, Power, or Advanced. The menu will present options such as balanced, cool (run fans harder), quiet (reduce fan speed and allow higher temperatures), fanless, and custom. There will also be settings for minimum temperature, which is the value at which fans will be started to cool the system. Duty cycle settings are used to control the frequency of power pulses to keep the fan running. A high percentage makes the fan run faster.

The setup program will also report the current temperature of the probes located near each fan connector.
## BIOS Password and Secure Boot
----
A **boot password** requires the user to authenticate before the operating system is loaded. Different system software will provide different support for authentication methods. There are usually at least two passwords, though some systems may allow for more:

- **Supervisor/Administrator/Setup**—Protect access to the system setup program.
- **User/System**—Lock access to the whole computer. This is a very secure way of protecting an entire PC as nothing can be done until the firmware has initialized the system.

*You must tell everyone who uses the PC the password, which weakens the security considerably. This option would be used only on workstations and servers that aren't used for interactive logon, such as computers running monitoring or management software.*

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924112808.png)

**Secure boot** is a UEFI feature designed to prevent a computer from being hijacked by malware. Under secure boot, the computer firmware is configured with cryptographic keys that can identify trusted code. The system firmware checks the operating system boot loader using the stored keys to ensure that it has been digitally signed by the OS vendor. This prevents a boot loader that has been modified by malware or an OS installed without authorization from being used.

## Trusted Platform Modules
----
**Encryption** products make data secure by scrambling it in such a way that it can only subsequently be read if the user has the correct decryption key. This security system is only strong as long as access to the key is protected. UEFI-based systems provide built-in secure storage for cryptographic keys.

*Encryption encodes data using a key to give it the property of confidentiality. Many cryptographic processes also make use of hashing. A secure hash is a unique code that could only have been generated from the input. Hashes can be used to compare two copies of data to verify that they are the same. Unlike encryption, the original data cannot be recovered from the hash code.*

### TPM
----
**Trusted platform module (TPM)** is a specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, cryptographic keys, and hashed passwords. The TPM establishes a root of trust. Each TPM microprocessor is hard coded with a unique, unchangeable key, referred to as the endorsement key. During the boot process, the TPM compares hashes of key system state data (system firmware, boot loader, and OS kernel) to ensure they have not been tampered with. The TPM chip has a secure storage area that a disk encryption program such as Windows BitLocker can write its keys to.

The TPM can be enabled or disabled and reset via the system setup program, though it is also possible to manage it from the OS as well.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230924113010.png)

### Hardware Security Module
----
It is also possible to use a removable USB thumb drive to store keys. This is useful if the computer does not support TPM, as a recovery mechanism in case the TPM is damaged, or if a disk needs to be moved to another computer. A secure USB key or thumb drive used to store cryptographic material can be referred to as a **hardware security module (HSM)**. Secure means that the user must authenticate with a password, personal identification number (PIN), or fingerprint before he or she is able to access the keys stored on the module.
# CPU Architecture
----

## x86 CPU Architecture
----
Over the years, many different internal **CPU architectures** have been developed to optimize the process of fetch, decode, execute, and writeback, while retaining compatibility with the **x86**-32 or IA-32 (Intel Architecture) instruction set. This x86 instruction set defines a CPU as IBM PC compatible. x86 PC processors are designed and manufactured by **Intel** and **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**.

## x64 CPU Architecture
----
x86 is a 32-bit instruction set. 32-bit means that each instruction can be up to 32-bits wide. However, since the early 2000s most CPUs have been capable of running 64-bit code. The x86 instruction set has been extended for 64-bit operation as the **x64** instruction set, developed initially by AMD as AMD64 or x86-64. Intel refers to it as EM64T or Intel 64.

All firmware and software—operating system, device drivers, and applications—must be specifically designed and compiled to run as 64-bit software. No 32-bit CPU can run 64-bit software. However, a 64-bit CPU can run 32-bit software.

*A device driver is code that provides support for a specific model of hardware component for a given operating system.*

## ARM CPU Architecture
----
The principal alternative to the standard x86/x64 CPU architecture is one devised by **Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)**. Unlike AMD and Intel, ARM do not manufacture CPUs. Instead, they produce designs that hardware vendors customize and manufacture. ARM designs are used in the current generation of Apple hardware, in most Android smartphones and tablets (notably by the vendors Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Samsung), in many Chromebooks, and in some Windows tablets and laptops. A typical ARM design implements a system-on-chip (SoC). SoC means that all the controllers—video, sound, networking, and storage—are part of the CPU. ARM designs use fewer, less complex instructions than is typical of x86. These features allow much better power and thermal efficiency, meaning longer battery life and the use of passive (fanless) cooling.

*An x86/x64 platform is complex instruction set computing (CISC), meaning that it uses a larger number (say around 1,000) of relatively more complex instructions. A single complex instruction might generate multiple operations across the CPU’s registers and take multiple clock cycles to complete. Reduced ISC (RISC) uses a small number of simpler instructions (say 100). This means that tasks require the execution of more instructions than with CISC, but each takes precisely one clock cycle. Because there are fewer instructions overall, RISC can make better use of the CPU registers and cache.*

For an operating system and hardware drivers to run on an ARM-based device, they must be redesigned and compiled to use the ARM instruction set. While this task is typically within the reach of operating system developers, converting existing x86/x64 software applications to run on a different instruction set is an onerous task. Another option is support for emulation. This means that the ARM device runs a facsimile of an x86 or x64 environment. Windows 10 ARM-based devices use emulation to run x86 and x64 software apps. Emulation typically imposes a significant performance penalty, however.





# Expansion Cards

## Sound Card
----
Audio playback is achieved via speakers or headphones, which are connected to a **sound card** via an audio jack. Sound cards are also used to record input from a microphone. Most audio jacks are 3.5 mm (⅛ inch) mono or stereo jacks. These are also referred to as phone plugs or mini tip, ring, sleeve (TRS) connectors.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924113625.png)

Sound cards supporting multiple output channels with an appropriate speaker system can provide various levels of playback, from mono (on legacy systems) or stereo to some type of surround sound. Surround sound uses multiple speakers positioned around the listener to provide a "cinematic" audio experience.

A basic sound chip may be provided as part of the motherboard chipset, but better-quality audio functions can be provided as a PCIe or PCI expansion card. Pro-level cards may also feature onboard memory, flash memory storing sound samples (wavetables), and additional jack types for different input sources.

*Audio hardware built into a computer may be susceptible to noise from other internal components when using recording functionality. Consequently, most audio interfaces designed for professional use are external units connected via USB or Thunderbolt.*






## Video Card and Capture Cards
----
An **expansion card** adds functions or ports that are not supported by the integrated features of the motherboard. An expansion card can be fitted to an appropriate PCIe or PCI slot. Some of the main types of expansion card are sound, video, capture, and network.

### Video Cards
----
The **video card** (or graphics adapter) generates the signal to drive a monitor or projector. Low-end graphics adapters are likely to be included with the motherboard chipset or as part of the CPU itself. This is also referred to as an onboard adapter or onboard graphics. If a computer is to be used for 3-D gaming, computer-aided design (CAD), or digital artwork, a more powerful video adapter is required. This can be installed as an add-on card via a PCIe slot. Most graphics adapters are based on chipsets by ATI/AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel. Video cards are distinguished by the following features:

- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**—A microprocessor designed and optimized for processing instructions that render 2-D and 3-D images and effects on-screen. The basic test for a GPU is the frame rate it can produce for a particular game or application. Other performance characteristics include support for levels of texture and lighting effects.
- **Graphics memory**—3-D cards need a substantial amount of memory for processing and texture effects. A dedicated card may be fitted with up to 12 GB GDDR RAM at the high end; around 4–6 GB would be more typical of current mid-range performance cards. Low-end cards use shared memory (that is, the adapter uses the system RAM). Some cards may use a mix of dedicated and shared memory.
- **Video ports**—The type and number of connectors, such as HDMI, DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt.

*Graphics Double Data Rate (GDDR) memory technology is similar to the DDR modules used for system RAM.*

Most modern cards use a PCIe x16 interface. The slot typically has a retaining latch at the end to hold the card securely in place. Dual cards, using two (or more) slots, are also available.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924113836.png)


### Capture Cards

Where a graphics card generates an output video signal to drive a monitor, a **capture card** is used to record video input and save it as a type of movie or streaming media file. Many capture cards are designed to record footage from computer games. Some are designed to work with PC games, while others record from game console HDMI sources or from a live camera HDMI source, such as a camcorder or security camera. Another class of capture card can act as a TV tuner and record video from broadcast TV sources.

A capture card can be fitted as an internal PCIe or as an external unit connected via USB/Thunderbolt.

## NIC
----
Most computers have an Ethernet network adapter already installed as part of the motherboard chipset. However, there may be occasions when you need to install an add-on **network interface card (NIC)** or need to upgrade an adapter to use a different type of network or cabling/connector, such as copper cable versus fiber optic. A dedicated NIC may also provision multiple ports. These can be bonded into a single higher bandwidth link.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924114112.png)


# Cooling
----
Components in a computer system emit heat because of some degree of resistance when electrical current passes through them. Without a cooling solution, this heat will raise the temperature of each component and increase the ambient temperature inside the case. Excessive temperatures can cause the components to malfunction or even damage them. This issue particularly affects CPUs. While Intel and AMD are both focusing on making new CPU designs more thermally efficient, all CPUs require **cooling** to keep the temperature within an acceptable operational range.

## Heat Sinks and Thermal Paste
----
A **heat sink** is a block of copper or aluminum with fins. The fins expose a larger surface area to the air around the component to achieve a cooling effect by convection. The heat sink is "glued" to the surface of the chip using **thermal paste** to ensure the best transfer of heat by eliminating small air gaps. A **thermal pad** performs a similar function. The pad is a compound that is solid at room temperature but softens when heated. This can be easier to apply but does not always perform as reliably.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230924114521.png)

There are various mechanisms for clamping a CPU heat sink to the motherboard. There may be a retaining clip or push pins. Push pins can be released and reset for insertion by making a half turn with a screwdriver.

### Fans

A heat sink is a passive cooling device. Passive cooling means that it does not require extra energy (electricity) to work. To work well, a heat sink requires good airflow around the PC. It is important to try to keep "cable clutter" to a minimum and to ensure that spare adapter slots are covered by blanking plates.

Many PCs have components that generate more heat than can be removed by passive cooling. A **fan** improves airflow, which helps to dissipate heat. Fans are used for the power supply and chassis exhaust points. The fan system will be designed to draw cool air from the low vents in the front of the case over the motherboard and expel warmed air from the fan positioned at the top of the back of the case. Most heat sinks are fitted with fans to improve their cooling performance. The fan's power connector must be plugged into a motherboard fan power port.

Thermometer sensors are used at each fan location to set an appropriate speed and to detect whether a fan has failed.

Some chassis designs incorporate a plastic shroud or system of baffles to cover the CPU and channel the flow of air. The shroud is usually attached to the case using plastic clips.

Both fans and heat sinks become less effective if dust is allowed to build up. These components and any air vents should be cleaned periodically, either manually with a soft brush and/or compressed air or using a vacuum cleaner approved for use with PCs.
## Liquid Cooling Systems

PCs used for high-end gaming may generate more heat than basic thermal management can cope with. PCs used where the ambient temperature is very high may also require exceptional cooling measures.

A **liquid-based cooling system** refers to a system of pumping water around the chassis. Water is a more effective coolant than air convection, and a good pump can run more quietly than numerous fans.

An open-loop, liquid-based cooling system uses the following components:

- The water loop/tubing and pump push the coolant added via the reservoir around the system.
- Water blocks and brackets are attached to each device to remove heat by convection. These are attached in a similar way to heat sink/fan assemblies and then connected to the water loop.
- Radiators and fans are positioned at air vents to dispel the excess heat.

*There are also simpler closed-loop systems that install to a single component (CPU or GPU) only.*

An open-loop system will usually need draining, cleaning, and refilling periodically. It is also important to keep the fans and radiators dust-free. The system should also be drained prior to moving the PC to a different location.
