# Network Cables
## Unshielded Twisted Pair
----

The most popular type of **network cable** is of a **copper** wire construction called "**unshielded twisted pair**" **(UTP)**. UTP is made up of four copper conductor wire pairs. Each pair of insulated conductors is twisted at a different rate from the other pairs, which reduces interference. The electrical signals sent over each pair are balanced. This means that each wire carries an equal but opposite signal to its pair. This is another factor helping to identify the signal more strongly against any source of interference. However, the electrical signaling method is still only reliable over limited range. The signal suffers from attenuation, meaning that it loses strength over long ranges. Most UTP cable segments have a maximum recommended distance of 100 m (328 feet).

## Shielded Twisted Pair
----

**Shielded twisted pair (STP)** provides extra protection against interference. Shielded cable is often used for 10G Ethernet and higher within datacenter networks because it is more reliable than UTP. Shielding may also be a requirement in environments with high levels of external interference, such as cable that must be run in proximity to fluorescent lighting, power lines, motors, and generators.

Shielded cable can be referred to generically as "STP," but several types of shielding and screening exist:

- Screened cable has one thin outer foil shield around all pairs. Screened cable is usually designated as screened twisted pair (ScTP) or foiled/unshielded twisted pair (F/UTP), or sometimes just foiled twisted pair (FTP).
- Fully shielded cabling has a braided outer screen and foil-shielded pairs and is referred to as "shielded/foiled twisted pair" (S/FTP). There are also variants with a foil outer shield (F/FTP).

![](Pasted%20image%2020230920173550.png)

The screening/shielding elements of shielded cable must be bonded to the connector to prevent the metal from acting as a large antenna and generating interference. Modern F/UTP and S/FTP solutions (using appropriate cable, connectors, and patch panels) facilitate this by incorporating bonding within the design of each element.

## CAT Standards
----
A Cat specification is a particular twisted pair cable construction method rated for use with given Ethernet standards. Higher Cat specification cable is capable of higher data rates. Cat specifications are defined in the TIA/EIA-568-C Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standards.

|Cat|Max. Transfer Rate|Max. Distance|Ethernet Standard Support|
|---|---|---|---|
|5|100 Mbps|100 m (328 ft)|100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet)|
|5e|1 Gbps|100 m (328 ft)|1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet)|
|6|1 Gbps|100 m (328 ft)|1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet)|
|10 Gbps|55 m (180 ft)|10GBASE-T (10G Ethernet)|
|6A|10 Gbps|100 m (328 ft)|10GBASE-T (10G Ethernet)|

The Cat specification is printed on the cable jacket along with the cable type (UTP or F/UTP, for instance). Cat 5 cable supports the older 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet standard. It is no longer commercially available. A network cabled with Cat 5 will probably need to be rewired to support Gigabit Ethernet.

Cat 5e would still be an acceptable choice for providing Gigabit Ethernet links for client computers, but most sites would now opt to install Cat 6 cable. The improved construction standards for Cat 6 mean that it is more reliable than Cat 5e for Gigabit Ethernet, and it can also support 10 Gbps, though over reduced range.

Cat 6A supports 10 Gbps over 100 m, but the cable is bulkier and heavier than Cat 5e and Cat 6, and the installation requirements more stringent, so fitting it within pathways designed for older cable can be problematic. TIA/EIA standards recommend Cat 6A for healthcare facilities, with Power over Ethernet (PoE) 802.3bt installations, and for running distribution system cable to wireless access points.

## Copper Cabling Connectors
----
Twisted pair cabling for Ethernet can be terminated using modular **RJ45** connectors. RJ45 connectors are also referred to as "8P8C," standing for eight-position/eight-contact. Each conductor in four-pair Ethernet cable is color-coded. Each pair is assigned a color (orange, green, blue, and brown). The first conductor in each pair has a predominantly white insulator with stripes of the color; the second conductor has an insulator with the solid color.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230920174122.png)

The TIA/EIA-568 standard defines two methods for terminating twisted pair: **T568A/T568B**. In T568A, pin 1 is wired to green/white, pin 2 is wired to green, pin 3 is wired to orange/white, and pin 6 is wired to orange. In T568B, the position of the green and orange pairs is swapped over, so that orange terminates to 1 and 2 and green to 3 and 6. When cabling a network, it is best to use the same termination method consistently. A straight through Ethernet cable is wired with the same type of termination at both ends.

*Using T568A at one end and T568B at the other creates a crossover cable. Crossover cables were once used to connect computers directly, but Gigabit Ethernet interfaces can perform the crossover automatically, even if standard cable is used.*

Twisted-pair can also be used with RJ11 connectors. Unlike the four-pair cable used with Ethernet, RJ11 is typically used to terminate two-pair cable, which is widely used in telephone systems and with broadband digital subscriber line (DSL) modems.

## Optical
----
Copper wire carries electrical signals, which are sensitive to interference and attenuation. The light pulses generated by lasers and LEDs are not susceptible to interference and suffer less from attenuation. Consequently, **optical cabling** can support much higher bandwidth links, measured in multiple gigabits or terabits per second, and longer cable runs, measured in miles rather than feet.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230920174348.png)

An **optical fiber** consists of an ultra-fine core of glass to convey the light pulses. The core is surrounded by glass or plastic cladding, which guides the light pulses along the core. The cladding has a protective coating called the "buffer." The fiber optic cable is contained in a protective jacket and terminated by a connector.

Fiber optic cables fall into two broad categories: single-mode and multi-mode:

- Single-mode fiber (SMF) has a small core (8â€“10 microns) and is designed to carry a long wavelength (1,310 or 1,550 nm) infrared signal, generated by a high-power, highly coherent laser diode. Single-mode cables support data rates up to 10 Gbps or better and cable runs of many kilometers, depending on the quality of the cable and optics.
- Multi-mode fiber (MMF) has a larger core (62.5 or 50 microns) and is designed to carry a shorter wavelength infrared light (850 nm or 
- 1,300 nm). MMF uses less expensive and less coherent LEDs or vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and consequently is less expensive to deploy than SMF. However, MMF does not support such high signaling speeds or long distances as single-mode and so is more suitable for LANs than WANs.

The core of a fiber optic connector is a ceramic or plastic ferrule that ensures continuous reception of the light signals. Several connector form factors are available:

- **Straight tip (ST)** is a bayonet-style connector that uses a push-and-twist locking mechanism; it is used mostly on older multi-mode networks.
- **Subscriber connector (SC)** has a push/pull design that allows for simpler insertion and removal than fiber channel (FC) connector. There are simplex and duplex versions, though the duplex version is just two connectors clipped together. It can be used for single- or multi-mode.
- **Lucent connector (LC)** is a small form factor connector with a tabbed push/pull design. LC is similar to SC, but the smaller size allows for higher port density.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230920174419.png)

Patch cords for fiber optic can come with the same connector on each end (ST-ST, for instance) or a mix of connectors (ST-SC, for instance). Fiber optic connectors are quite easy to damage and should not be repeatedly plugged in and unplugged. Unused ports and connectors should be covered by a dust cap to minimize the risk of contamination.


## Coaxial Cabling
----
**Coaxial** (coax) cable is a different type of copper cabling, also carrying electrical signals. Where twisted pair uses balancing to cancel out interference, coax uses two conductors that share the same axis. The core signal conductor is enclosed by plastic insulation (dielectric), and then a second wire mesh conductor serves both as shielding from EMI and as a ground.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230920174552.png)

Coax is now mostly used for CCTV installations and as patch cable for Cable Access TV (CATV) and broadband cable modems. Coax for CATV installations is typically terminated using a screw-down **F-type connector**.

## Plenum & Direct Burial
----

Installation of cable must be compliant with local building regulations and fire codes. This means that specific cable types must be used in some installation scenarios.

### Plenum Cable

A plenum space is a void in a building designed to carry heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Plenum space is typically a false ceiling, though it could also be constructed as a raised floor. As it makes installation simpler, this space has also been used for communications wiring in some building designs. Plenum space is an effective conduit for fire, as there is plenty of airflow and no fire breaks. If the plenum space is used for heating, there may also be higher temperatures. Therefore, building regulations require the use of fire-retardant plenum cable in such spaces. Plenum cable must not emit large amounts of smoke when burned, be self-extinguishing, and meet other strict fire safety standards.

General purpose (non-plenum) cabling uses PVC jackets and insulation. Plenum-rated cable uses treated PVC or fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP). This can make the cable less flexible, but the different materials used have no effect on bandwidth. Data cable rated for plenum use under the US National Electrical Code (NEC) is marked as CMP/MMP on the jacket. General purpose cables are marked CMG/MMG or CM/MP.

### Direct Burial

Outside plant (OSP) is cable run on the external walls of a building or between two buildings. This makes the cable vulnerable to different types of weathering:

- Aerial cable is typically strung between two poles or anchors. The ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight plus exposure to more extreme and changing temperatures and damp will degrade regular PVC.
- Conduit can provide more protection for buried cable runs. Such cable can still be exposed to extreme temperatures and damp, however, so regular PVC cable should not be used.
- Direct burial cable is laid and then covered in earth or cement/concrete.

OSP cable types use special coatings to protect against UV and abrasion and are often gel filled to protect against temperature extremes and damp. Direct burial cable may also need to be armored to protect against chewing by rodents.

# Peripheral Cables
---
## USB 
----

The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is the standard means of connecting most types of peripheral device to a computer. USB peripheral device functions are divided into classes, such as human interface (keyboards and mice), mass storage (disk drives), printer, audio device, and so on.

A USB is managed by a host controller. 
In theory, there could be up to 127 connected devices per controller, but to overcome the limitations of sharing bandwidth, most PC motherboards provision multiple USB controllers, each of which has three or four ports.

### USB Standards

There have been several iterations of the USB standard. Each version introduces better data rates. A version update may also define new connector form factors and other improvements. The **USB 2.0** HighSpeed standard specifies a data rate of 480 Mbps shared between all devices attached to the same host controller. The bus is half-duplex, meaning that each device can send or receive, but not at the same time.

Iterations of USB 3.x introduced new connector form factors and upgraded transfer rates, each of which are full-duplex, so a device can send and receive simultaneously. USB 3.2 deprecated some of the older terms used to describe the supported transfer rate:

![](Pasted%20image%2020230921112829.png)


### USB Connector Types

The connector form factors specified in USB 2 are as follows:

- Type Aâ€”For connection to the host and some types of peripheral device. The connector and port are shaped like flat rectangles. The connector should be inserted with the USB symbol facing up.
- Type Bâ€”For connection to large devices such as printers. The connector and port are square, with a beveled top.
- Type B **Mini**â€”A smaller peripheral device connector. This type of connector was seen on early digital cameras but is no longer widely used.
- Type B **Micro**â€”An updated connector for smaller devices, such as smartphones and tablets. The micro connector is distinctively flatter than the older mini type of connector.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230921112956.png)


A USB cable can feature Type A to Type A connectors or can convert from one type to another (Type A to Type B or Type A to Micro Type B, for instance).

In USB 3, there are new versions of the Type A, Type B, and Type B Micro connectors with additional signaling pins and wires. USB 3 receptacles and connectors often have a blue connector tab or housing to distinguish them. USB 3 Type A connections are physically compatible with USB 1.1 and 2.0 connections, but the Type B/Type B Micro connections are not. So, for example, you could plug a USB 2 Type A cable into a USB 3 Type A port, but you could not plug a USB 3 Type B cable into a USB 2 Type B port.

USB 3.1 defines the USB-C connector type. This compact form factor is intended to provide a single, consistent hardware interface for the standard. The connector is reversible, meaning it can be inserted either way up. The connector design is also more robust than the earlier miniB and microB types. USB-C can use the same type of connector at both ends, or you can obtain USB-C to USB Type A or Type B converter cables.

### Cable Length

The maximum cable length for LowSpeed devices is 3 m, while for FullSpeed and HighSpeed the limit is 5 m. Vendors may provide longer cables, however. Although SuperSpeed-capable cables do not have an official maximum length, up to about 3 m is recommended.

### Power

As well as a data signal, the bus can supply power to the connected device. Most USB Type A and Type C ports can be used to charge the battery in a connected device.

## Serial
----
Legacy
	tx data 1 wire 1 bit at a time
Referred to as Recommended Standard #232 or RS-232

Data rates 115Kbps ONLY

Serial ports are generally associated with connecting external modems, used to establish dial-up Internet connections, though even this function has largely been superseded by USB. You may also come across serial ports on network equipment, where a serial connection can be used to manage the device.

RS-232 specifies a 25-pin hardware interface, but in practice, PC manufacturers used the cheaper 9-pin D-subminiature (**DB-9**) female port shown above.

In Windows, the serial port is referred to as a Communications (COM) port.

PS/2 i used to attach mice and keyboards. PS/2 ports use a 6-pin mini-DIN format. The green color-coded port is used to attach a mouse, and the purple one is for a keyboard.

## Thunderbolt / Lightning
----
**Thunderbolt** can be used as a display interface like DisplayPort or HDMI and as a general peripheral interface like USB.

versions 1 and 2 use the same physical interface as MiniDP and are compatible with DisplayPort so that a monitor with a DisplayPort port can be connected to a computer via a Thunderbolt port and a suitable adapter cable

Version 2 of the standard supports links of up to 20 Gbps. Like DisplayPort multiple monitors can be connected to a single port by daisy-chaining.

Version 3 changes the physical interface to use the same port, connector, and cabling as USB-C

Thunderbolt 3 supports up to 40 Gbps over a short, high-quality cable (up to 0.5 m/1.6 ft.).

The Lightning port is found only on Apple's mobile devices. To connect such a device to a PC, you need a suitable adapter cable, such as Lightning-to-USB A or Lightning-to-USB C.



# Video Cables

## HDMI
----
Video Requirements
-  The resolution of the image, measured in horizontal pixels by vertical pixels. For example, 1920x1200 is the typical format of high-definition (HD) video and 3840x2160 is typical of 4K video.
- The speed at which the image is redrawn, measured in hertz (Hz) or frames per second (fps).

The **High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)** is the most widely used video interface

HDMI supports both video and audio, plus remote control and digital content protection (HDCP). Updates to the original HDMI specification have introduced support for high resolutions, such as 4K and 8K, and gaming features, such as the ability to vary the monitor refresh rate to match the frame rate of the video source.

There are full-size (Type A), mini (Type C), and micro (Type D) connectors, all of which are beveled to ensure correct orientation.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230921114739.png)

HDMI cable is rated as either Standard (Category 1) or High Speed (Category 2). High Speed cable supports greater lengths and is required for v1.4 features, such as 4K and refresh rates over 60 Hz. HDMI versions 2.0 and 2.1 specify Premium High Speed (up to 18 Gbps) and Ultra High Speed (up to 48 Gbps) cable ratings.


## DisplayPort

HDMI was developed by consumer electronics companies and requires a royalty to use. **DisplayPort** was developed as a royalty-free standard by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), which is an organization that represents PC graphics adapter and display technology companies.

Bandwidth can be allocated in bonded lanes (up to four). The bitrate of each lane was originally 2.7 Gbps but is now (with version 2.0) up to 20 Gbps.

One of the main advantages of DisplayPort over HDMI is support for daisy-chaining multiple monitors to the same video source. Using multiple monitors with HDMI requires one video card port for each monitor.


## DVI / VGA
----
**Digital Visual Interface (DVI)** is designed to support both analog and digital outputs. While popular for a period after its introduction in 1999, DVI is no longer in active development. You are only likely to encounter DVI on older display devices and video cards.

There are five types of DVI, supporting different configurations for single and dual link (extra bandwidth) and analog/digital output signaling. The pin configuration of the connectors identifies what type of DVI is supported by a particular port.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230921115138.png)

DVI-I supports both analog equipment and digital outputs. DVI-A supports only analog output and DVI-D supports only digital.

**Video Graphics Array (VGA)**
15 pin

VGA will usually support resolutions up to HD (1920x1080), depending on cable quality. The connector is a D-shell type with screws to secure it to the port.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230921115223.png)

# Hard Drive Cables
----
## SATA

standard means of connecting internal storage drives within a desktop PC. SATA uses cables of up to 1 m (39 in.) terminated with compact 7-pin connectors. Each SATA host adapter port supports a single device.

A separate 15-pin SATA power connector is used to connect the device to the PCâ€™s power supply.

first commercially available SATA standard supported speeds of up to 150 MBps. This standard was quickly augmented by SATA revision 2 (300 MBps) and then SATA revision 3 (600 MBps).

## Molex
Internal storage device data cables are unpowered. While the SATA power connector is the best option for new devices, legacy components connect to the power supply unit (PSU) via a **Molex** connector. A Molex connector is usually white or clear plastic and has 4 pins. The color coding of the wire insulation represents the DC voltage: red (5 VDC), yellow (12 VDC), and black (ground).
![](Pasted%20image%2020230921115603.png)

## eSATA
standard for the attachment of peripheral drives, with a 2 m (78 in.) cable. You must use an eSATA cable to connect to an external eSATA port; you cannot use an internal SATA cable. eSATAp is a nonstandard powered port used by some vendors that is compatible with both USB and SATA (with an eSATAp cable). The USB interface dominates the external drive market, however.

## SCSI
----
Legacy
 SCSI could support data rates up to 320 MBps.
One SCSI host bus adapter (HBA) can control multiple devices attached by internal ribbon cables or external SCSI cables


Each device on a wide SCSI bus must be configured with a unique ID, from 0 to 15. The host adapter is usually set to 7 or 15. A bootable hard disk is usually allocated ID 0. The first and last devices on a SCSI bus must be terminated. Termination may either be enabled internally on the device by setting a switch or by physically connecting a terminator pack to a device or the host adapter.

Additionally, you should note that while parallel SCSI as a physical interface has almost completely disappeared, the software interface and command set are used in many other storage technologies, including serial attached SCSI (SAS). SAS is a dominant interface for enterprise-class storage devices in the PC workstation and server market.


## IDE
**integrated drive electronics (IDE)** interface was the principal mass storage interface for desktop PCs for many years. The interface is also referred to as parallel advanced technology attachment (PATA). The extended IDE (EIDE) bus interface uses 16-bit parallel data transfers.

A motherboard supporting IDE may come with one or two host adapters, called the IDE1 channel and the IDE2 channel. These may also be labelled primary (PRI IDE) and secondary (SEC IDE). A single IDE channel is now more typical if the motherboard also supports SATA. Each IDE channel supports two devices, 0 and 1.

An EIDE cable typically has three color-coded connectors. The blue connector is for the motherboard port. The black (end) and grey (middle) connectors attach to devices 0 and 1 respectively. When inserting a connector, pin 1 on the cable must be oriented with pin 1 on the port. On the cable, pin 1 is identified with a red stripe. The connectors are also keyed to prevent them from being inserted the wrong way around.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230921120335.png)

nfortunately, the terms master and slave were used to distinguish device 0 and device 1. CompTIA and the computing industry generally are working to eliminate this type of non-inclusive terminology
