Before you can provide the right level of support for print services, you must understand how the various components work within each type of print device to provide the desired outputs. In this topic, you will learn the components and maintenance procedures for laser, inkjet, thermal, impact, and 3-D print device types.

# Laser
----
Laser printers are one of the most popular printer technologies for office applications because they are inexpensive (both to buy and to run), quiet, and fast, and they produce high-quality output that does not smear or fade. There are both grayscale and color models.

The laser print process follows the steps detailed in the following sections.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925085438.png)

### Processing Stage

Laser printers produce output as a series of dots. The OS driver encodes the page in a page description language and sends it to the print device. In the **processing** stage, the printer's formatter board processes the data to create a bitmap (or raster) of the page and stores it in the printer's RAM.

### Charging Stage

In the **charging** stage, the **imaging** **drum** is conditioned by the primary charge roller (PCR). The PCR is a metal roller with a rubber coating powered by a high voltage power supply assembly. The PCR applies a uniform -600 V electrical charge across the drum's surface. 

### Exposing Stage

The surface coating of the photosensitive imaging drum loses its charge when exposed to light. In the **exposing** stage, as the laser receives the image information, it fires a short pulse of light for each dot in the raster to neutralize the charge that was applied by the PCR. The pulsing light beam is reflected by a polygonal mirror through a system of lenses onto the rotating photosensitive drum. The drum ends up with a series of raster lines with charge/no-charge dots that represent an electrostatic latent image of the image to be printed.

### Developing Stage

Laser toner is composed of a fine compound of dyestuff and either wax or plastic particles. The toner is fed evenly onto a magnetized **developer** **roller** from a hopper.

The developer roller is located very close to the photosensitive drum. The toner carries the same negative charge polarity as the drum, which means that, under normal circumstances, there would be no interaction between the two parts. However, once areas of charge have been selectively removed from the photosensitive drum by the laser, the toner is attracted to them and sticks to those parts of its surface. The drum, now coated with toner in the image of the document, rotates until it reaches the paper.

*The imaging drum, PCR, developer roller, and toner hopper are provided as components within a toner cartridge.*

### Transferring Stage

The **transferring** stage moves the toner from the drum onto the print media. The paper transport mechanism includes components such as gears, pads, and rollers that move the paper through the printer. Pickup components lift a single sheet of paper from the selected input tray and feed it into the printer. To do this, a **pickup roller** turns once against the paper stack, pushing the paper into a **feed** and **separation roller** assembly. This assembly is designed to allow only one sheet to pass through.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925085535.png)

*A printer will have a number of automatic trays and a manual tray. The manual feed tray uses a **separation pad** rather than rollers.*

When the paper reaches the registration roller, a signal tells the printer to start the image development process. When the drum is ready, the paper is fed between the imaging drum and the high voltage **transfer roller**. The transfer roller applies a positive charge to the underside of the paper. This causes the toner on the drum to be attracted to the paper. As the paper leaves the transfer assembly, a static eliminator strip (or detac corona) removes any remaining charge from the paper. This is done to avoid the paper sticking to the drum or curling as it enters the fuser unit.

### Fusing Stage

From the transfer assembly, the paper passes into the **fuser** **assembly**. The fuser unit squeezes the paper between a hot roller and a pressure roller so that the toner is melted onto the surface of the paper. The hot roller is a metal tube containing a heat lamp; the pressure roller is typically silicon rubber. The heat roller has a Teflon coating to prevent toner from sticking to it.

### Cleaning Stage

To complete the printing cycle, the photosensitive drum is cleaned to remove any remaining toner particles using a cleaning blade, roller, or brush resting on the surface of the drum. Any residual electrical charge is removed, using either a discharge (or erase lamp) or the PCR.

*The entire laser printer cycle takes place in one smooth sequence, but since the circumference of the drum that processes the image is smaller than a sheet of paper, the early stages must be repeated 2–4 times (according to size) to process a single page.*

### Duplex Printing and Paper Output Path

When the paper has passed through the fuser, if a **duplexing assembly** unit is installed, it is turned over and returned to the developer unit to print the second side. Otherwise, the paper is directed to the selected output bin using the exit rollers.

If there is no auto duplex unit, the user can manually flip the paper stack. When manual duplex mode is selected for the print job, the printer pauses after printing the first side of each sheet. The user must then take the printed pages and return them (without changing the orientation) to the same input paper tray. Once this is done, the user can resume the print job.

### Color Laser Printers

Color laser print devices use separate toner cartridges for each additive CMYK color. Color laser printers can use different processes to create the image. Some may use four passes to put down each color in turn; others combine the colored toner on a **transfer belt** and print in one pass.
# Laser Maintenance
----
As devices with mechanical parts and consumable items that deplete quickly, printers need more maintenance than most other IT devices. Printers generate a lot of dirt—principally paper dust and ink/toner spills—and consequently require regular cleaning. Consumable items also require replacing frequently under heavy use. To keep a print device working in good condition requires a regular maintenance schedule and user training.

*When performing any type of maintenance other than loading paper, unplug the printer from the power supply. Open the panels, and allow all components to cool to room temperature.*

### Loading Paper

The printer will report when a tray runs out of paper. When loading new paper, remember the following guidelines:

- Use good quality paper designed for use with the model of printer that you have and the required output type (document versus photo, for instance).
- Position the media guides at the edges of the loaded stack. The printer uses sensors from the guides to detect the paper size. Different trays may support different types, sizes, and thicknesses of media. Do not add unsupported media to a tray or overload it.
- Do not use creased, dirty, or damp paper. Ensure that paper is stored in a climate-controlled location with no excessive humidity, temperature, or dust.
### Replacing the Toner Cartridge

You will need to maintain a supply of the proper **toner cartridges** for your printer model. When toner is low, the printer will display a status message advising you of the fact. Frugal departments may continue printing until the actual output starts to dip in quality. Removing the cartridge and rocking gently from front-to-back can help to get the most out of it. Color lasers will usually have four cartridges for the different colors, which can be replaced separately.

To replace the toner cartridge, remove the old cartridge by opening the relevant service panel and pulling it out. Place the cartridge in a bag to avoid shedding toner.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925140824.png)

Take the new cartridge and remove the packing strips as indicated by the instructions. Rock the cartridge gently from front to back to distribute the toner evenly. Insert the cartridge, close the service panel, turn on, and print a test page.

*The drum in the toner cartridge is light-sensitive. Fit the cartridge in the print device immediately.*

Toner cartridges are Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and must be disposed of according to local regulations, such as by recycling them at an approved facility. Do not dispose of cartridges as general waste.

### Cleaning the Printer

Consult and follow the manufacturer's specific recommendations for **cleaning** and maintenance. The following guidelines generally apply:

- Use a damp cloth to clean exterior surfaces.
- Wipe dust and toner away from the printer interior or exterior with a soft cloth, or use a toner-safe vacuum.

*Do not use a compressed air blaster to clean a laser printer! You risk blowing toner dust into the room, creating a health hazard. Do not use an ordinary domestic vacuum cleaner. Toner is conductive and can damage the motor. Toner is also so fine that it will pass straight through the dust collection bag and back into the room.*

- If toner is spilled on skin or clothes, wash it off with cold water. Using hot water is not recommended because heat can open the pores of your skin and allow toner particles to penetrate more easily.
- Use IPA (99% Isopropyl Alcohol solution) and non-scratch, lint-free swabs to clean rollers and electronic contacts. Take care not to scratch a roller.
- Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for replacing the printer's dust and ozone filters regularly.

### Replacing the Maintenance Kit

A **maintenance kit** is a set of replacement feed rollers, transfer roller, and fuser unit. Replacement of the maintenance kit is guided by the printer's internal copy count of the number of pages that it has printed. The printer's status indicator will display the message "Maintenance Kit Replace" at this point.

Remove the old fuser and rollers and clean the printer. Install the fuser and new rollers—remembering to remove the packing strips and following the instructions carefully.

As with toner cartridges, use a recycling program to dispose of the fuser unit and old rollers in an environmentally responsible manner.

### Calibrating a Printer

**Calibration** is the process by which the printer determines the appropriate print density or color balance (basically, how much toner to use). Most printers calibrate themselves automatically. If print output is not as expected, you can often invoke the calibration routine from the printer's control panel or its software driver.


# Inkjet Printer Imaging Process
----
**Inkjet printers** are often used for good-quality color output, such as photo printing. Inkjets are typically cheap to buy but expensive to run, with costly consumables such as ink cartridges and high-grade paper. Compared to laser printers, they are slower and often noisier, making them less popular in office environments, except for low-volume, good-quality color printing.

### Inkjet Printer Imaging Process

Inkjets work by firing microscopic droplets of ink at the paper. The process creates high-quality images, especially when specially treated paper is used, but they can be prone to smearing and fading.

There are two main types of inkjet **print head**. Epson printers use a charge (or piezoelectric) method. HP, Canon, and Lexmark use a thermal method. Each of these four vendors has licensed its inkjet technology to several other vendors to produce re-branded versions of its printers.

- With the thermal method, the ink at each nozzle in the print head is heated, creating a bubble. When the bubble bursts, it sprays ink through the nozzle and draws more ink from the reservoir. In general, thermal inkjet print heads are cheaper and simpler to produce, but the heating elements have a relatively short life. Most thermal printers use a combined print head and ink reservoir. When the ink runs out, the print head is also replaced.
- In the Epson design, the nozzle contains a piezoelectric element, which changes shape when a voltage is applied. This acts like a small pump, pushing ink through the nozzle and drawing ink from the reservoir.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925141521.png)

### Carriage System

Inkjet printers build up the image line by line. The print head is moved back and forth over the paper by a **carriage system**. On some types of printers, ink is applied when the print head moves in one direction only; bidirectional models apply ink on both the outward and return passes over the page. The carriage system uses a stepper motor, pulley, and **belt** to move the print head, a guide shaft to keep the print head stable, and sensors to detect the position of the print head. A flat ribbon data cable connects the print head to the printer's circuit board.

When a line has been completed, another stepper motor advances the page a little bit, and the next line or row is printed.

There may also be a lever used to set the platen gap or the printer may adjust this automatically depending on driver settings. The platen gap is the distance between the print head and the paper. Having an adjustable platen gap allows the printer to use thicker media.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925141538.png)



# Inkjet Maintenance
----
Inkjets do not usually handle such high print volumes as laser printers, so maintenance focuses on paper stocking and replacing or refilling ink cartridges, which always seem to run down very quickly. Manufacturers recommend not trying to clean inside the case as you are likely to do harm for no real benefit. The outside of the printer can be cleaned using a soft, damp cloth.

### Paper Handling and Duplexing Assembly

Most inkjets only support one paper path, with single input and output trays, though some have automatic duplexers, and some may have accessory trays. Printers are generally split between models that load from the top and output at the bottom and those that have both input and output bins at the bottom and turn the paper (an "up-and-over" path).

1. The paper pickup mechanism is similar to that of a laser printer. A load **roller** turns against the paper stack to move the top sheet while a separation **roller** prevents more than one sheet entering.
2. When the paper is sufficiently advanced, it is detected by a sensor. The stepper motor controlling the paper-feed mechanism advances the paper as the print head completes each pass until the print is complete.
3. The eject rollers then deliver the paper to the **duplexing assembly** (if installed and duplex printing has been selected) or the output bin. Some inkjets with a curved paper path may have a "straight-through" rear panel for bulkier media.

Inkjets tend to have smaller paper trays than laser printers and therefore can need restocking with paper more often. Most inkjets can use "regular" copier/laser printer paper, but better results can be obtained by using less absorbent, premium grades of paper stock, specifically designed for inkjet use. Often this type of paper is designed to be printed on one side only—make sure the paper is correctly oriented when loading the printer.

### Replacing Inkjet Cartridges

Inkjet print heads are often considered consumable items. Often this is unavoidable because the print head is built into the **ink cartridge**, as is the case with most (but not all) thermal print heads. Epson piezoelectric print heads are non-removable and designed to last as long as the rest of the printer components.

The cartridge reservoir has sensors to detect the level of ink remaining. A color printer needs at least four reservoirs for each of the CMYK inks. These reservoirs may come in a single cartridge or there may be separate cartridges for black and colored ink, or each ink may come in its own cartridge. Some inkjets use light cyan and light magenta inks to support a wider color gamut.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925141701.png)

When the inkjet's driver software determines that a cartridge is empty, it will prompt you to replace it. Check the printer's instruction manual for the correct procedure.

### Other Inkjet Maintenance Operations

Two other maintenance operations may be required periodically.

- **Print head alignment**—If output is skewed, use the print head alignment function from the printer's property sheet to **calibrate** the printer. This is typically done automatically when you replace the ink cartridges.
- **Print head cleaning**—A blocked or dirty nozzle will show up on output as a missing line. Use the printer's cleaning cycle (accessed via the property sheet or control panel) to try to fix the problem. If it does not work, there are various inkjet cleaning products on the market.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925141720.png)



# Thermal Printer Maintenance
----
A **thermal printer** is a general term for any device that uses a heating element to create the image on the paper. There are several types of thermal printers that use significantly different technologies and are intended for different uses, but the most common type that you are likely to have to support is the direct thermal printer. Portable or small form factor direct thermal transfer printers are used for high-volume barcode and label printing and to print receipts. Such devices typically support 200–300 dpi, with some models able to print one or two colors. Print speeds are measured in inches per second.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925141855.png)
### Direct Thermal Printer Imaging Process

Most direct thermal print devices require special **thermal paper** that contains chemicals designed to react and change color as it is heated by the **heating element** within the printer to create images.

In the **feed assembly**, paper is friction-fed through the print mechanism by a stepper motor turning a rubber-coated roller. Paper and labels may be fanfold or roll format.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925141910.png)

### Direct Thermal Printer Maintenance Tips

When you are **replacing the paper roll**, you need to obtain the specific size and type for the brand and model of thermal printer you are using. The process is usually quite simple—just open the printer case, insert the roll, keeping the shiny, **heat****-sensitive** print side facing outward, then ensure that the end of the paper is held in place by the print head when closing the case again.

Each receipt is separated by ripping the paper across serrated teeth. This can lead to a buildup of paper dust in the printer. It can also lead to bits of **paper debris** becoming lodged in the mechanism if a clean slice is not made and bits of leftover paper fall into the printer. Use a vacuum or soft brush to remove any paper debris.

Label printers can end up with sticky residue inside the printer. If labels are not loaded correctly, they can separate from the backing while being fed through the printer. You will need to ensure users know how to properly load the labels and how to clean up if labels get stuck inside the printer. Use a swab and appropriate cleaning fluid, such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA), to clean the print head or any sticky residue inhibiting the feed mechanism. Alternatively, you can often purchase cleaning cards to feed through the printer to clean the print head safely.

# Impact Printer Maintenance
----
An **impact printer** strikes an inked ribbon against paper to leave marks. One common type is the dot matrix printer, which uses a column of pins in a print head to strike the ribbon. Desktop dot matrix devices are no longer very widely deployed for document printing, but they are still used for specialist functions such as printing invoices or pay slips on continuous, tractor-fed paper.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925142040.png)

### Impact Printer Paper

Impact printers can be used with either plain, carbon, or tractor-fed paper:

- Plain paper is held firmly against the moving roller (the platen) and pulled through the mechanism by friction as the platen rotates. A cut sheet feeder may be added to some printers to automate the process of providing the next page.
- Carbon paper (or **impact paper**) is used to make multiple copies of a document in the same pass (hence carbon copy, or "cc"). A sheet of carbon paper is inserted between each sheet of plain paper, and when the print head strikes, the same mark is made on each sheet.
- **Tractor-fed** paper is fitted with removable, perforated side strips. The holes in these strips are secured over studded rollers at each end of the platen. This type of paper is more suitable for multi-part stationery as there is less chance of skewing or slippage since the end rollers fix the movement of the paper.

When you are **loading a tractor-fed impact printer with paper**, ensure that the holes in the paper are engaged in the sprockets and that the paper can enter the printer cleanly. Ensure that the lever is in the correct position for friction feed or tractor feed as appropriate for the media being used. 

### Impact Printer Components

An impact printer will also have some form of **replaceable ribbon**. Older-style printers used to have a two-spool ribbon. However, most units now have a cartridge device that slots over or around the carriage of the print head. These integrated ribbons simplify the design of the printer because they can be made as a complete loop moving in one direction only. The two-spool design requires a sensor and reversing mechanism to change the direction of the ribbon when it reaches the end.

When the ribbon on an impact printer fails to produce sufficiently good print quality, the ribbon-holder and contents are normally replaced as an integrated component. Some printers can use a re-usable cartridge.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions to **replace the print head**. Take care, as the print head may become very hot during use.

# 3D Printer Maintenance
----
A **3-D print process** builds a solid object from successive layers of material. The material is typically some sort of plastic, but there are printer types that can work with rubber, carbon fiber, or metal alloys too.

3-D printing has very different use cases to printing to paper. It is most widely used in manufacturing, especially to create proof-of-concept working models from designs. The range of other applications is growing, however. For example, 3-D printing can be used in healthcare (dentistry and prosthetics), the clothing industry, and to make product samples and other marketing material.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925142156.png)

### 3-D Printer Imaging Process

The 3-D printer imaging process begins with either a scan of an existing object or by creating a design using 3-D modeling software. From either of these methods, you end up with a 3-D model created in software and saved to a 3-D model format.

The model is rendered into discrete horizontal layers or slices. The slicing software might be contained in the 3-D modeling software or within the 3-D printer. The result is a print job specifying how each layer in the finished object is to be deposited.

The sliced model is then fed to the 3-D printer over a USB or Wi-Fi connection or by inserting an SD card containing the file into the printer. The printer then melts a filament and extrudes it onto the build surface, creating layer upon layer based on the slices. The extruder (and sometimes the build bed) is moved as needed on X/Y/Z axes to create the build.

### 3-D Printer Components

There are several types of 3-D printers. Fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM), lays down layers of filament at a high temperature. As layers are extruded, adjacent layers are allowed to cool and bond together before additional layers are added to the object. The main components in an FDM 3-D printer are:

- **Print bed**/**build plate**—a flat glass plate onto which the material is extruded. The bed is usually heated to prevent the material from warping. The bed must be leveled for each print job—this is usually automated, but cheaper printer models require manual calibration. It is very important that the printer frame be strong and rigid enough to keep the bed as stable as possible. Any vibration will result in poor-quality printing.
- **Bed/build surface**—a sheet placed onto the base plate to hold the object in position while printing but also allow its removal on completion. The bed surface material may need to be matched to the filament material for best results.
- **Extruder**—the equivalent of a print head in an inkjet. A motor in the extruder draws filament from the "cold end" through to the nozzle (or "hot end"), where it is melted and squirted onto the object. Different-size nozzles can be fitted to the extruder.
- **Gears/motors/motion control**—enable precise positioning of the extruder.
- **Fan**—cools the melted plastic where necessary to shape the object correctly.

The printer must be installed in a suitable environment. A stable, vibration-free floor and dust-free, humidity-controlled surroundings will ensure best results.

*3-D printing involves several possible safety risks. Components work at high temperatures, and use of sharp tools such as scrapers and finishing knives is required. Ideally, the 3-D print facility should be accessible only to trained users.*

### Filament

The "ink" for a 3-D printer is supplied as a spool of **filament**. Filament is provided in a diameter of either 1.75 mm or 3 mm. There are various filament materials. The two most popular plastics are polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Most printers can use a range of filament types, but it is best to check compatibility if a specific "exotic" is required for a project. Each material operates at different extruder and print-bed temperatures.

To change a filament, the extruder must be heated to the appropriate temperature. Pull as much of the old filament out as possible—taking care not to burn yourself—then push the new filament through. Do not start printing until all the old filament has been pushed out.

Filament spools require careful storage once opened. They should be kept free from heat and humidity.

### Resin and Other 3-D Printer Types

There are two other common types of 3-D printer. These use different materials than filament:

- Stereolithography (SLA) uses liquid plastic **resin** or photopolymer to create objects which are cured using an ultraviolet laser. Excess photopolymer is stored in a tank under the print bed. The print bed lowers into the tank as the object is created. A liquid solvent removes uncured polymer after the model is finished.
- Selective laser sintering (SLS) fuses layers together using a pulse laser. The object is created from a powder and lowered into a tank as each layer is added. The powder can be plastic or metal.



# Review
----
1. **What must you do before installing a new toner cartridge into a printer?**

Remove the packing strips. The printer should also be turned off, and the old cartridge should be removed and placed into a sealed bag for recycling.

2. **Which components are provided as part of a laser printer maintenance kit?**

The main component is a new fuser assembly. The kit will also usually contain a transfer/secondary charge roller plus paper transport rollers for each tray (pickup rollers and a new separation pad).

3. **What types of paper/stationery can dot matrix printers use that laser and inkjet printers cannot?**

Multi-part or continuous tractor-fed stationery and carbon copy paper.

4. You have been asked to perform basic maintenance on a printer in the Research and Development area. The dot matrix printer used to create shipping documents seems to be printing lighter than normal, and one of the pins seems to not be connecting near the center of the print head as there are blank areas in some letters and images. What maintenance should you perform?

Using the steps in the printer documentation, replace the ribbon in the printer and clean the print head. If this does not fix the problem, replace the print head.

5. A thermal printer used to create labels for parts bins, kits, and boxes is jammed due to a label coming loose during printing. How should you resolve this problem?

Open the printer and locate the label that came off the backing. Remove the label, and if there is any sticky residue, clean it with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) applied to a swab. Ensure the roll of labels is properly loaded and that there are no loose labels that might come loose again.

6. What considerations for locating a 3-D printer do you have to make?

The 3-D print process is sensitive to movement and vibration, so the printer must be located on a firm and stable surface. The process can also be affected by dust and the ambient temperature and humidity (especially variations and drafts). Finally, some printer types are fully exposed, so there is some risk of burns from the high-heat elements. Ideally, the printer should not be accessible to untrained staff.
