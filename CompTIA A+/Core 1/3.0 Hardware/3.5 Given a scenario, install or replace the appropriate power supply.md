Understanding the power requirements of all the components and the max pwr output is curcial in managing new builds, upgrades, and repairs. Along with power, all PC components generate heat. Managing heat by installing and maintaining cooling systems make for a more reliable computing environment. A computer that runs too hot risks damaging its own components and is likely to run at reduced performance levels.

# Power Supply Units
----
The power supply unit (PSU) delivers direct current (DC) low voltage power to the PC components. A PSU contains a rectifier to convert alternating current (AC ) building power to DC voltage output, transformers to step down to lower voltages, and filters and regulators to ensure consistent output voltage levels. The other important component in the PSU is the fan, which dissipates the heat generated.

The power supply's size and shape determine its compatibility with the system case, in terms of available room plus screw and fan locations. The form factor also determines compatibility with the motherboard, in terms of power connectors. Most PSUs designed for use with desktop PCs are based on the ATX form factor.

A PSU is plugged into an electrical outlet using a suitable power cord. Before doing this, you must ensure that the PSU is compatible with the **input voltage** from the outlet. A PSU designed only for use in North America, where the input voltage for most homes and offices is 120 VAC (low-line), will not work in the UK, where the voltage is 230 VAC (high-line). Also, facilities such as data centers typically use high-line voltage because it is more efficient. Most PSUs are dual voltage and are auto-switching; some have a manual switch to select the correct voltage; fixed voltage types can only accept either low-line or high-line. The input operating voltages should be clearly marked on the unit and accompanying documentation.

# Wattage Rating
----
Power is the rate at which things generate or use energy. Power is measured in in watts (W), calculated for electrical components as voltage multiplied by current (V*I). A PSU must be able to meet the combined power requirements of the PC's components. The PSU's output capability is measured as its **wattage rating**. A PSU designed for use in a standard desktop PC is typically rated at around 200–300 W. Enterprise workstation PCs and servers often have units rated over 300 W to meet the demands of multiple CPUs, additional memory modules, disk drives, and tape units. Gaming PCs might require 500 W or better power supplies to cope with the high specification CPU and graphics card(s).


*The power requirement of different components varies widely. For example, CPUs can range from 17 W to over 100 W, depending on the model. If you are building or upgrading a system, the simplest way to work out the power requirement is to use an online calculator. Examples of these tools include [enermax.outervision.com](https://enermax.outervision.com/) and [coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/).*

*The power output is not the same as the power the PSU draws from grid power. If a PSU works at around 75% efficiency, a 300 W supply would draw 400 W from the outlet. The extra energy is lost mainly as heat. As energy becomes more expensive both in terms of cost and in terms of the climate, power efficiency is an important criterion to use when selecting a PSU. An ENERGY STAR 80 PLUS compliant PSU must be 80% efficient at 20–100% of load.*

When specifying a PSU for a system with high power requirements, it is also important to assess the power distribution for its **output voltages (3.3 VDC, 5 VDC, and 12 VDC)**. Distribution refers to how much power is supplied over each rail. A rail is a wire providing current at a particular voltage. The following table shows an example of how power distribution for a PSU might be configured:

# Power Supply Connectors
----
Each PSU has a number of power connectors attached. The power connectors supply DC voltage to the motherboard and devices at 3.3 VDC, 5 VDC, and 12 VDC. Not all components use power at precisely these voltages.  Voltage regulators are used to correct the voltage supplied from the PSU to the voltage required by the component. The motherboard’s power port is referred to as the P1 connector. A PSU will also have a number of Molex and/or SATA device power connectors and 4/6/8-pin connectors for use with CPU and PCIe adapter card power ports.

### 20-pin to 24-pin Motherboard Adapter

The ATX PSU standard has gone through several revisions, specifying different connector form factors. In the original ATX specification, the P1 connector is 20-pin (2x10). Wires with black insulation are ground, yellow are +12 V, red are +5 V, and orange are +3.3 V.

Most systems are now based on the ATX12V version 2 specification. This defines a 24-pin (2x12) P1 form factor to replace the 20-pin one. Some PSUs have a **20+4-pin P1 adapter cable** for compatibility with older motherboards with a 20-pin port.

### Modular Power Supplies

A **modular PSU** has power connector cables that are detachable from the unit. Reducing the number of cables to the minimum required minimizes clutter within the chassis, improving air flow and cooling. For example, a non-modular PSU might have four or five Molex or SATA device power connectors, but the PC might only require two of them. With a modular PSU, the unnecessary cables can be removed.

### Redundant Power Supplies

A computer system may be fitted with two PSUs, with one acting as a failover **redundant power supply**. This could also be connected to a different grid power circuit. A redundant PSU configuration requires a compatible motherboard. This configuration is more commonly found on server systems than on desktop PCs. On a server, typically each PSU plugs into a backplane and is hot-swappable. This allows a faulty unit to be removed and replaced without having to open the case and without the server ever losing power.
