Despite predictions that computers would bring about a paperless office environment, the need to transfer digital information to paper or back again remains strong. As a CompTIA® A+® certified professional, you will often be called upon to set up, configure, and troubleshoot print and scan devices. Having a working knowledge of the many printer technologies and components will help you to support users' needs in any technical environment.

# Printer Setup
----
A printer type or printer technology is the mechanism used to make images on the paper. The most common types for general home and office use are inkjet (or ink dispersion) and laser, though others are used for more specialist applications. Some of the major print device vendors include HP, Epson, Canon, Xerox, Brother, OKI, Konica/Minolta, Lexmark, Ricoh, and Samsung.

*There is a distinction between the software components that represent the printer and the physical printer itself. The software representation of the printer may be described as the "printer object," "logical printer," or simply "printer." Terms relating to the printer hardware include "print device" or "physical printer." Be aware that "printer" could mean either the physical print device or the software representation of that device. Pay attention to the context in which these terms are used.*

The following criteria are used to select the best type and model of printer:

- The basic speed of a printer is measured in pages per minute (ppm). You will see different speeds quoted for different types of output. For example, pages of monochrome text will print more quickly than color photos.
- The maximum supported resolution, measured in dots per inch (dpi), determines output quality. Printer dots and screen image pixels are not equivalent. It requires multiple dots to reproduce one pixel at acceptable quality. Pixel dimensions are typically quoted in pixels per inch (ppi) to avoid confusion. Vertical and horizontal resolution are often different, so you may see figures such as 2400x600 quoted. The horizontal resolution is determined by the print engine (that is, either the laser scanning unit or inkjet print head); vertical resolution is determined by the paper handling mechanism.
- Paper handling means the sizes and types of paper or media that can be loaded. It may be important that the printer can handle labels, envelopes, card stock, acetate/transparencies, and so on. The amount of paper that can be loaded and output is also important in high-volume environments. Overloaded output trays will cause paper jams. If the output tray is low capacity, this could happen quite quickly in a busy office.
- Options add functionality. Examples include an automatic duplex unit for double-sided printing and a finisher unit for folding, stapling, and hole punching. These may be fitted by default or available for purchase as an add-on component.


### Setup Location 
----
When deploying a new print device, consider the following factors to select an optimum **setup location**:

- The print device must have a power outlet and potentially a network data port. Ensure that cables are run without being trip hazards and that the print device is placed on a stable, flat surface that can bear the device weight with no risk of toppling.
- As with a PC, ensure that the print device is not exposed to direct sunlight and that there is space around it for air to flow. The area should be well-ventilated to ensure dispersal of fumes such as ozone generated during printer operation. Printer paper and most consumables should be stored where there is no risk of high humidity or temperature extremes. Consult the material safety data sheet (MSDS) accompanying the print device to check for any other special installation considerations.
- The print device should be accessible to its users, but take account of noise and foot traffic that might be disruptive to employees working at nearby desks. If a print device is used to output confidential information, it may need to be installed in an access-controlled area.

### Unboxing
----
When you have selected an installation location, follow the manufacturer’s instructions to unbox and set up the printer. Be aware of the following general factors:

- Many print devices are heavy and may require two persons to lift safely. Make sure you use safe lifting techniques and bend at the knees to avoid damaging your back. Identify handle locations on the device, and use only those to grip and lift it. If carrying a bulky device, ensure the path is free from trip hazards.
- Printer parts will be secured using packing strips and supports. Ensure that these are all removed before the printer is switched on. Remember to check for strips on removable components that are concealed by panels.
- A print device should normally be left to acclimate after removing the packaging materials. Leave the device unboxed and powered off for a few hours to reduce risks from condensation forming within an appliance that has moved from a cold storage/transport environment to a warmer installation environment. Similarly, printer paper should be stored for a day or more before use to allow it to adjust to the temperature and humidity of the installation location.



# Printer Drivers and Page Description Languages
----
Applications that support printing are typically what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG), which means that the screen and print output are supposed to be identical. To achieve this, the printer **driver** provides an interface between the print device and the operating system. If a networked print device is used by clients with different OSs, each client must be installed with a suitable driver. Note that if the client OS is 64-bit, a 64-bit driver is required.

The appropriate print driver will normally be selected and installed when the print device connection is detected. This is referred to as Plug and Play (PnP). In some circumstances, you might need to add the driver manually or choose a driver version with support for a particular page description language (PDL).

A PDL is used to create a raster file from the print commands sent by the software application. A raster file is a dot-by-dot description of where the printer should place ink. In general terms, a PDL supports the following features:

- **Scalable fonts**—originally, characters were printed as bitmaps. A bitmap font consists of dot-by-dot images of each character at a particular font size. This meant that the character could only be printed at sizes defined in the font. Scalable fonts are described by vectors. A vector font consists of a description of how each character should be drawn. This description can be scaled up or down to different font sizes. All Windows printers support scalable TrueType or OpenType fonts.
- **Vector graphics**—as with fonts, scalable images are built from vectors, which describe how a line should be drawn rather than provide a pixel-by-pixel description, as is the case with bitmap graphics.
- **Color printing**—computer displays use an additive red, green, blue color model. The subtractive model used by print devices uses the reflective properties of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) inks. A PDL’s support for a particular color model provides an accurate translation between on-screen color and print output and ensures that different devices produce identical output.

*The "K" in CMYK is usually explained as standing for "key," as in a key plate used to align the other plates in the sort of offset print press used for professional color printing in high volumes. It might be more helpful to think of it as "blacK," though.*

The choice of which PDL to use will largely be driven by compatibility with software applications. Adobe PostScript is a device independent PDL and often used for professional desktop publishing and graphical design output. HP’s Printer Control Language (PCL) is more closely tied to individual features of printer models and can introduce some variation in output depending on the print device. PCL is usually a bit faster than PostScript, however. Many Windows print devices default to using Microsoft’s XML paper specification (XPS) PDL.

# Print Device Connectivity
----
Each print device supports a range of wired and wireless connection interfaces.

### USB Print Device Connectivity

Install a printer with **USB connectivity**, connect the device plug (usually a Type B connector) to the printer's USB port and the Type A host plug to a free port on the computer. In most cases, the OS will detect the printer using Plug and Play and install the driver automatically. You can confirm that the printer is successfully installed and print a test page using the driver or OS utility.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925080502.png)

### Ethernet Print Device Connectivity

Most printers are fitted with an Ethernet network adapter and RJ45 port. The print device can be configured to obtain an Internet Protocol (IP) configuration from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server or be manually configured. The print device’s IP can also be registered as a host record on a Domain Name System (DNS) server to facilitate client connections via a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Most printers provide a mechanism for locally configuring the printer’s network settings. Usually, this is by means of a menu system that you navigate by using an LCD display and adjacent buttons or a touchscreen on the front of the printer.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925080525.png)

This method is suitable for small office environments where you have few printers to manage. It is also useful in troubleshooting situations when the printer is inaccessible from the network. However, the printer vendor will usually supply a web-based utility to discover and manage its printers, whereas more advanced management suites are available for enterprise networks.


![](Pasted%20image%2020230925080537.png)

The printer will need to communicate with computers over one or more TCP or UDP network ports. If a network connection cannot be established, verify that these ports are not being blocked by a firewall or other security software.

### Wireless Print Device Connectivity

The two principal **wireless** printer interfaces are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

To connect a Windows client to a printer via Bluetooth, use the print device control panel to make it discoverable, then use the **Bluetooth** page in Windows Settings to add the device.

Wi-Fi connectivity can be established in two different ways:

- **Infrastructure mode**—Connect the print device to an access point to make it available to clients on the network via an IP address or FQDN. The printer's wireless adapter must support an 802.11 standard available on the access point.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925080559.png)

- **Wi-Fi Direct**—Configure a software-implemented access point on the print device to facilitate connections to client devices.


# Printer Sharing
----
The interfaces on a print device determine how it is connected to the network. The printer **sharing** model describes how multiple client devices access the printer.

Some printers come with integrated or embedded print server hardware and firmware, allowing client computers to connect to them directly over the network without having to go via a server computer.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925081011.png)

A **public** printer is configured with no access controls so any guest client may use it.

### Windows Print Server Configuration

As an alternative to allowing clients to connect directly to the print device, any computer with a print device installed can share that printer object for use by other client computers. The print server could be connected to the print device via a local USB port or over the network. This sharing model allows more administrative control over which clients are allowed to connect. The printer object can be configured with permissions that allow only authenticated users to submit print jobs.

In Windows, a share is configured using the **Sharing** tab in the printer’s **Properties** dialog. Drivers for different operating systems can also be made available so that clients can download and install the appropriate driver when they connect to the print share.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925081026.png)

If the network has clients running a mix of different operating systems, you need to consider how to make a printer driver available for each supported client. If the printer supports a "Type 3" driver, you need only add x86 (32-bit Windows) and/or x64 (64-bit Windows) support. For earlier "Type 2" drivers, each specific Windows version requires its own driver.

For earlier "Type 2" drivers, each specific Windows version requires its own driver.*

### Shared Printer Connections

Ordinary users can connect to a network printer if the print server administrator has given them permissions to use it. One way of doing this is to browse through the network resources using the **Network** object in **File Explorer**. Open the server computer hosting the printer, then right-click the required printer and select **Connect**.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925081124.png)



# Printing Preferences
----
In contrast to the Properties dialog box, the Preferences dialog sets the default print job options, such as the type and **orientation** of paper or whether to print in color or black and white. These settings can also be changed on a per-job basis by selecting the Properties button in the application's Print dialog. Alternatively, the printer may come with management software that you can use to change settings.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925081427.png)

### Paper/Quality

The **Paper/Quality** tab allows you to choose the type of paper stock (size and type) to use and whether to use an economy or draft mode to preserve ink/toner. You can also use the **Color** tab to select between color and grayscale printing.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925081446.png)

### Finishing

The **Finishing** tab lets you select output options such as whether to print on both sides of the paper (duplex), print multiple images per sheet, and/or print in portrait or landscape orientation.
# Printing Properties
----
Each logical printer object can be set up with default **configuration settings** via its driver or app.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925082034.png)
In Windows, there are two main configuration dialogs for a local printer: **Printer Properties** and **Printing Preferences**.

A printer's **Properties** dialog allows you to manage configuration settings for the printer object and the underlying hardware, such as updating the driver, printing to a different port, sharing and permissions, setting basic device options (such as whether a **duplex** unit or finisher unit is installed), and configuring default paper types for different feed **trays**.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925082048.png)

The **About** tab contains information about the driver and the printer vendor and may include links to support and troubleshooting tips and utilities.


# Printer Security
----
Use of printers raises several security issues, including access to print services and risks to the confidentiality of printed output.

### User Authentication

It may be necessary to prevent unauthorized use of a network printer. User authentication means that the printer sharing server or print device will only accept print jobs from authorized user accounts.

User authentication can be configured on a print share. For example, in Windows, the Sharing and Security tabs can be configured with a list of users or groups permitted to submit print jobs.

The print device might support user authentication options for clients who connect directly. A local authentication option means that a list of valid usernames and passwords is stored on the print device itself. A network option means that the print device can communicate with a directory server to authenticate and authorize users.

### Secured Print and Badging

A **secured print** is held on the print device until the user authenticates directly with the print device. This mitigates the risk of confidential information being intercepted from the output tray before the user has had time to collect it. Authentication to release the print job might be supported using different formats:

- PIN entry requires the user to input the correct password or code via the device control panel.
- Badging means the print device is fitted with a smart card reader. The employee must present his or her ID badge to the reader to start the print job.

The secured print option may be selected as a default option or configured for a particular print job. Secured prints may only be cached for a limited time and deleted if not printed in time. The print device might require a memory card or other storage to cache encrypted print jobs.

### Audit Logs

A printer share server or print device can be configured to **log** each job. This provides an **audit** record of documents that were sent to the printer by given user accounts and client devices. An audit log could be used to identify documents that were printed and have gone missing or to identify unauthorized release of information. If the log is generated on the print device, a log collector such as syslog can be configured to transmit the logs to a centralized log server.



# Scanner Configuration
----
Many office printers are implemented as multi-function devices (MFDs). An MFD typically performs the functions of a printer, scanner/copier, and fax machine.

A **scanner** is a digital imaging device, designed to create computer file data from a real-life object. Typically, scanners handle flat objects, like documents, receipts, or photographs. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software can be used to convert scanned text into digital documents, ready for editing.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230925082526.png)

### Scanner Types

Scanners are available in two basic formats:A flatbed scanner works by shining a bright light at the object, which is placed on a protective glass surface. A system of mirrors reflects the illuminated image of the object onto a lens. The lens either uses a prism to split the image into its component RGB colors or focuses it onto imaging sensors coated with different color filters. This information is used to create a bitmap file of the object.An automatic document feeder (ADF) passes paper over a fixed scan head. This is a more efficient means of scanning multi-page documents.

### Network Scan Services

An MFD or standalone scanner can be configured as a network device in the same way as a basic print device. When configured on the network, one or more services is used to direct the scan output to a particular media:

- Scan to email means that the scan is created as a file attachment to an email message. The MFD must be configured with the IP address of an SMTP server. The SMTP server would typically authenticate the user account before accepting the message for delivery.

- Server Message Block (SMB) or scan to folder means that the scan is created as a file on a shared network folder. The MFD must be configured with the path to a suitably configured file server and shared folder. Each user must have permission to write to the share.

- Scan to cloud services mean that the scan is uploaded as a file to a document storage and sharing account in the cloud. Cloud services such as OneDrive or Dropbox will generally be available as options on the MFD, or there may be the ability to configure a custom service via a template. The scan dialogs will allow the user to authenticate to a given cloud account.



# Review
----
1. Following some past issues with faults arising in print devices because of improper setup procedures, you are updating the company’s work instructions for printer installation. You have noted that technicians must refer to the product instructions, use safe lifting techniques, and ensure removal of packing strips. What additional guidance should you include?

Allow the print device to acclimate for a few hours after unboxing to avoid risks from condensation.

2. You use three Windows 10 applications that need to print to a Canon inkjet printer. How many printer drivers must you install?

One. Applications rely on the operating system to mediate access to devices. They do not need their own drivers. 

3. Users in the marketing department complain that a recently installed printer is not producing accurate color output. What step might resolve the problem?

Switch to a PostScript (PS) driver. This is likely to have better support for accurate color models. You might also suggest running a calibration utility.

4. True or false? To enable printer sharing via Windows, the print device must be connected to the Windows PC via an Ethernet or Wi-Fi link.

False—any print device can be shared via printer properties. The print device can be connected to the Windows print server over USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi. Other clients connect to the printer via the share, however, so the Windows PC must be kept on to facilitate printing.

5. **What configuration information does a user need to use a print device connected to the same local network?**

The print device's IP address or host name. You might note that vendor utilities can search for a connected device on the local network, so "None" could also be a correct answer.

6. To minimize paper costs, a department should use the duplex printing option on a shared printer by default. The print device is already configured with an automatic duplex finishing unit. What additional step should you take to try to ensure duplex printing?

Set duplex mode as the default under Printing Preferences.
