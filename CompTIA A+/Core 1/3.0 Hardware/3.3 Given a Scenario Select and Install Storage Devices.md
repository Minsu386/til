**Intro**
A PC is often much less valuable than the data that it stores and processes. This means that the reliability and performance of the devices used to store system files and user files is of critical importance. If these storage devices fail, the PC will not work, and valuable information may be lost. By identifying the types and characteristics of storage devices, you will be prepared to select, install, and maintain them to ensure a reliable computing environment for users.

# Hard Drives

## Form Factor
----
A mass storage device installed as an internal component is referred to as a fixed disk. Storage devices are produced in a number of standard widths: 5.25 inches, 3.5 inches, and 2.5 inches. The computer chassis has several drive bays to fit these form factors. Form factor bays with a 5.25-inch width are provided with removable panels so that they can be used with devices that have removable media, such as DVD drives and smart card readers.

A fixed disk is typically installed to a drive bay using a caddy. You screw the drive into the caddy, then screw the caddy into the drive bay. A caddy can also allow you to fit a drive of a different size to the bay. For example, you can fit a 2.5-inch drive in a 3.5-inch bay or a 3.5-inch drive in a 5.25-inch bay by using an adapter caddy. Some caddies use rails so that you can pull the drive out without having to open the case.

## Speeds
----
A **hard disk drive (HDD)** stores data on metal or glass platters that are coated with a magnetic substance. The top and bottom of each platter is accessed by its own read/write head, moved by an actuator mechanism. The platters are mounted on a spindle and spun at high speed. Each side of each platter is divided into circular tracks, and a track contains several sectors, each with a capacity of 512 bytes. This low-level formatting is also referred to as the drive geometry.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924083906.png)

This technology means that the performance of an HDD is determined by the speed at which the disks spin, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). High performance drives are rated at **15,000** or **10,000** rpm; average performance is **7,200** or **5,400** rpm. RPM is one factor determining access time, measured in milliseconds. Access time is the delay that occurs as the read/write head locates a particular track position, which is known as seek time. Access time is also impacted by the sector location process (rotational latency) on the drive. A high-performance drive will have an access time below 3 ms; a typical drive might have an access time of around 6 ms.

The internal transfer rate (or data or disk transfer rate) of a drive is a measure of how fast read/write operations are performed on the disk platters. A 15 K drive should support an internal transfer rate of up to about 180 MBps, while 7.2 K drives will be around 110 MBps.

Most HDDs use a SATA interface, though you may come across legacy devices using EIDE/PATA or SCSI interfaces. There are two main **form factors** for HDDs. The mainstream type used in desktop PCs are 3.5-inch units. The **2.5****-inch** form factor is used for laptops and as portable external drives.

# Solid State Drive
----
A **solid-state drive (SSD)** uses flash memory technology to implement persistent mass storage. Flash memory performs much better than the mechanical components used in hard disk drives, especially in terms of read performance. Risks from total failure of the device due to mechanical shock and wear are generally lower. Costs per gigabyte have fallen rapidly in the last few years.

On a typical modern desktop PC, an SSD might be installed as the computer's only internal drive or as a boot drive for use with an additional hard drive. In the second scenario, the SSD would be used to install the OS and software applications, while the HDD would be used for user data files.

In terms of the **communications interface**, an SSD might be packaged in a 2.5-inch caddy and installed to a **SATA** port using the normal SATA data and power connectors. Alternatively, the **mSATA** form factor allows an SSD packaged as an adapter card to be plugged into a combined data and power port on the motherboard. With both form factors, the main drawback is that the 600 MBps SATA interface can be a bottleneck to the best performing SSDs, which can achieve transfer rates of up to 6.7 GB/s.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924084848.png)

Consequently, modern SSDs often use the **PCI Express (PCIe)** bus directly. Where SATA uses the advanced host controller interface (AHCI) logical interface to communicate with the bus, PCIe-based SSDs use the non-volatile memory host controller interface specification (NVMHCI) or **NVM Express (NVMe)**.

An NVMe SSD can either be packaged for installation to a PCIe slot as an expansion card or to an M.2 slot. The M.2 adapter card form factor is considerably smaller than a PCIe adapter and oriented horizontally rather than vertically, so the interface is often used on laptops as well as PC motherboards. M.2 supplies power over the bus so there is no need for a separate power cable. M.2 adapters can be different widths and lengths so you should check that any given adapter will fit on your motherboard. Labels indicate the adapter sizes supported.

# RAID
----
Failure can happen to storage your storage device. Be it, a large capacity mechanical hard drive, or a Solid State drive. 

If a boot drive fails, the system will crash. If a data drive fails, users will lose access to files and there may be permanent data loss if those files have not been backed up. To mitigate these risks, the disks that underpin the mass storage system can be provisioned as a **redundant array of independent disks (RAID)**. Redundancy sacrifices some disk capacity but provides fault tolerance. To the OS, the RAID array appears as a single storage resource, or volume, and can be partitioned and formatted like any other drive.

*RAID can also be said to stand for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks," and the "D" can also stand for "devices."*

A RAID level represents a **drive configuration** with a given type of fault tolerance. Basic RAID levels are numbered from 0 to 6. There are also nested RAID solutions, such as RAID 10 (RAID 1 + RAID 0).

RAID can be implemented using features of the operating system, referred to as software RAID. Hardware RAID uses a dedicated controller, installed as an adapter card. The RAID disks are connected to SATA ports on the RAID controller adapter card, rather than to the motherboard.

Hardware solutions are principally differentiated by their support for a range of RAID levels. Entry-level controllers might support only RAID 0 or RAID 1, whereas mid-level controllers might add support for RAID 5 and RAID 10. In addition, hardware RAID is often able to hot swap a damaged disk. Hot swap means that the failed device can be replaced without shutting down the operating system.

## RAID 0 and RAID 1 
----
When implementing RAID, it is important to select the appropriate RAID level. The factors influencing this decision include the required level of fault tolerance, read/write performance characteristics, required capacity, and cost.

### RAID 0 Stripping w/out Parity
Disk striping divides data into blocks and spreads the blocks in a fixed order among all the disks in the array. This improves performance as multiple disks are available to service requests in parallel. **RAID 0** requires at least two disks. The logical volume size is the combined total of the smallest capacity physical disk in the array.

However, RAID 0 provides no redundancy at all. If any physical disk in the array fails, the whole logical volume will fail, causing the computer to crash and requiring data to be recovered from backup. Consequently, RAID 0 only has specialist uses—typically as some type of non-critical cache store.

### RAID 1 Mirroring
**RAID 1** is a mirrored drive configuration using two disks. Each write operation is duplicated on the second disk in the set, introducing a small performance overhead. A read operation can use either disk, boosting performance somewhat. This strategy is the simplest way of protecting a single disk against failure. If one disk fails, the other takes over. There is little impact on performance during this, so availability remains good, but the failed disk should be replaced as quickly as possible as there is no longer any redundancy. When the disk is replaced, it must be populated with data from the other disk. Performance while rebuilding is reduced, though RAID 1 is better than other levels in that respect and the rebuilding process is generally shorter than for parity-based RAID.

## RAID 5 and RAID 10
----

RAID 5 and RAID 10 have performance, disk utilization, and fault tolerance characteristics that can make them better choices than basic mirroring\

### RAID 5 Striping with Distributed Parity

RAID 5 uses striping (like RAID 0) but with distributed parity. Distributed parity means that error correction information is spread across all the disks in the array. The data and parity information are managed so that the two are always on different disks. If a single disk fails, enough information is spread across the remaining disks to allow the data to be reconstructed. Stripe sets with parity offer the best performance for read operations. However, when a disk has failed, the read performance is degraded by the need to recover the data using the parity information. Also, all normal write operations suffer reduced performance due to the parity calculation. 

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924090756.png)

RAID 5 requires a minimum of three drives but can be configured with more. This allows more flexibility in determining the overall capacity of the array than is possible with RAID 1. A "hard" maximum number of devices is set by the controller or OS support, but the number of drives used is more likely to be determined by practicalities such as cost and risk. Adding more disks increases the chance of failure. If more than one disk fails, the volume will be unavailable.

The level of fault tolerance and available disk space is inverse. As you add disks to the set, fault tolerance decreases but usable disk space increases. If you configure a RAID 5 set using three disks, a third of each disk is set aside for parity. If four are used, one-quarter is reserved on each disk. Using a three 80 GB disk configuration, you would have a 160 GB usable volume.

### RAID 10 Strip of Mirrors
----
A nested RAID configuration combines features of two basic RAID levels. **RAID 10** is a logical striped volume (RAID 0) configured with two mirrored arrays (RAID 1). This configuration offers excellent fault tolerance, as one disk in each mirror can fail, and the volume will still be available.

# Removable Storage
----
**Removable Storage** can refer either to a storage device that can be moved from computer to computer without having to open the case or to storage media that is removable from its drive.

## Drive Enclosures
----
HDDS and SSDs can be provisioned as removable storage in an enclosure. The enclosure provides a data interface (USB, Thunderbolt, or eSATA), a power connector ( if neccessary ), and protection for the disk. 

Some enclosures can be connected directly to a network rather than to a PC. This is referred to as network attached storage (NAS). Advanced enclosures can host multiple disk units configured as a RAID array.

## Flash Drives and Memory Cards
----
The flash memory underpinning SSDs can also be provisioned in the flash drive and memory card form factors. A **flash drive**—also called a USB drive, thumb drive, or pen drive—is simply a flash memory board with a USB connector and protective cover. This type of drive plugs into any spare USB port.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230924094206.png)

The **memory card** form factor is used in consumer digital imaging products, such as digital still and video cameras, and to expand smartphone and tablet storage. A PC can be fitted with a memory card reader device. These are usually designed to fit in a front-facing drive bay. The reader then needs to be connected to a USB controller. Most motherboards have at least one spare USB header for making internal connections. Alternatively, the reader may come with an expansion card.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230924094217.png)

There are several proprietary types of memory card, each of which also has different sizes and performance ratings. Most memory card readers work with multiple card types. As an example, Secure Digital (SD) cards are available in three capacity variants. The original SD cards have a 2 GB maximum capacity, whereas SDHC is up to 32 GB and SDXC is up to 2 TB. There are also four speed variants. The original specification is up to 25 MBps, UHS allows up to 108 MBps, UHS-II is rated at up to 156 MBps full-duplex or 312 MBps half-duplex, while UHS-III specifies two full-duplex rates of 312 MBps (FD312) and 624 MBps (FD624). Smaller form factor microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards are also available.


## Optical Drives
----

Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), and Blu-ray Discs (BDs) are mainstream storage formats for music and video retail. All types of optical media use a laser to read the data encoded on the disc surface.

These discs can also be used as storage media for PC data. Each disc type is available in recordable and rewritable formats:

- Basic recordable media can be written to once only in a single session.
- Multisession recordable media can be written to in more than one session, but data cannot be erased.
- Rewritable media can be written and erased in multiple sessions, up to a given number of write cycles.

Each optical disc type has different capacity and transfer rate:

- CD has a maximum capacity of 700 MB and is available in recordable (CD-R) and rewritable (CD-RW) formats. The base transfer rate of a CD is 150 KBps.
- DVD has a capacity of 4.7 GB for a single layer, single-sided disc up to about 17 GB for a dual-layer, double-sided disc. At launch, there were competing DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW recordable and rewritable formats, but most drives can use either, designated by the ± symbol. The base transfer rate for DVD is 1.32 MBps, equivalent to 9x CD speed.
- Blu-ray has a capacity of 25 GB per layer. The base speed for Blu-ray is 4.5 MBps, and the maximum theoretical rate is 16x (72 MBps).

An internal **optical drive** can be installed to a 5.25-inch drive bay and connected to the motherboard via SATA data and power connectors. An external unit would be connected via USB (or possibly eSATA or Thunderbolt). External optical drives typically require their own power supply, provided via a supplied AC adapter. Some drives use a tray-based mechanism, while other use a slot-loading mechanism.

Optical drives are rated according to their data transfer speed. An optical drive that can perform recording/rewriting is marketed with three speeds, always expressed as the record/rewrite/read speed (for example, 24x/16x/52x). New drives are generally multi-format, but you may come across older drives with no Blu-ray support.

Consumer DVDs and Blu-rays feature digital rights management (DRM) and region-coding copy-protection mechanisms. Region coding, if enforced, means that a disc can only be used on a player from the same region. On a PC, the region can usually be set using device properties. The firmware normally prevents this from being changed more than a couple of times.

# Review Question
----

1. **True or false? A solid-state drive (SSD) attached to an M.2 port must be using the non-volatile memory host controller interface specification (NVMHCI) or NVM Express (NVMe).**

False. M.2 is a physical form factor and can support both SATA and NVMe interfaces.

2. **What basic factor might you look at in selecting a high-performance hard disk drive?**

Revolutions per minute (RPM)—the speed at which it spins. The top-performing drives are 15,000 (15K) or 10,000 (10K).

3. **If you have a computer with three hard disks, what type of RAID fault-tolerant configuration will make best use of them?**

RAID 5 (striping with parity). RAID 0 is not fault tolerant. RAID 1 and RAID 10 require an even number of disks.

4. **You are configuring four 120 GB drives in a RAID 5 array. How much space will be available?**

360 GB.

5. **What is the minimum number of disks required to implement RAID 10, and how much of the disks' total capacity will be available for the volume?**

RAID 10 requires at least four disks (two mirrored pairs) and comes with a 50% capacity overhead, so the volume will only be half the total disk capacity.

6. **True or false? A memory card reader is needed to attach a thumb drive to a PC.**

False—a thumb or pen drive will plug into a USB port.
