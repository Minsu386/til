# Hypervisor
----
In a basic configuration, a single computer is designed to run a single OS at any one time. This makes multiple applications available on that computer—whether it be a workstation or server—but the applications must all share a common OS environment. Improvements in CPU and system memory technology mean that all but budget and entry-level computers are now capable of virtualization. Virtualization means that multiple OSs can be installed and run simultaneously on one computer.

The software facilitating this is called a "hypervisor." The OSs installed under the hypervisor are called virtual machines (VMs) or guest OSs. Any OS expects exclusive access to resources such as the CPU, system memory, storage devices, and peripherals. The hypervisor emulates these resources and mediates access to the actual system hardware to avoid conflicts between the guest OSs. The VMs must be provided with drivers for the emulated hardware components. The hypervisor might be limited in terms of the different types of guest OSs it can support.

There are two basic ways of implementing a hypervisor:

- In a guest OS (or host-based) system, the hypervisor application is itself installed onto a host OS. Examples of these Type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation™, Oracle® Virtual Box, and Parallels® Workstation. The hypervisor software must support the host OS, and the computer must have resources to run the host OS, the hypervisor, and the guest operating systems.

- A bare metal virtual platform means that a Type 1 hypervisor is installed directly onto the computer and manages access to the host hardware without going through a host OS. Examples include VMware ESXi® Server, Microsoft's Hyper-V®, and Citrix's XEN Server. The hardware needs to support only the base system requirements for the hypervisor plus resources for the type and number of guest OSs that will be installed.

# Uses for Virtualization
----
There are many different **purposes** for deploying virtualization.

### Client-Side Virtualization

**Client-side virtualization** refers to any solution designed to run on "ordinary" desktops or workstations. Each user will be interacting with the virtualization host directly. Desktop virtual platforms, usually based on some sort of guest OS hypervisor, are typically used for **testing and development**:

- **Sandbox**—Create an isolated environment in which to analyze viruses, worms, and Trojans. As the malware is contained within the guest OS, it cannot infect the researcher's computer or network.
- Support **legacy software applications and OSs**—If the host computers have been upgraded, software apps may not work well with the new OS. In this scenario, the old OS can be installed as a VM, and the application software accessed using the VM.
- **Cross-platform virtualization**—Test software applications under different OSs and/or resource constraints.
- Training—Lab environments can be set up so that students can practice using a live OS and software without impacting the production environment. At the end of the lab, changes to the VM can be discarded so that the original environment is available again for the next student to use.

### Server-Side Virtualization

Server-side virtualization means deploying a server role as a virtual machine. For server computers and applications, the main use of virtualization is better hardware utilization through server consolidation. A typical hardware server may have resource utilization of about 10%. This implies that you could pack the server computer with another 8–9 server software instances and obtain the same performance.

### Application Virtualization

**Application virtualization** means that the client either accesses a particular application hosted on a server or streams the application from the server for local processing. This enables programmers and application administrators to ensure that the application used by clients is always updated with the latest code.

Most application virtualization solutions are based on Citrix XenApp. Microsoft has developed an App-V product within its Windows Server range. VMware has the ThinApp product. 

### Container Virtualization

Container virtualization dispenses with the idea of a hypervisor and instead enforces resource separation at the OS level. The OS defines isolated containers for each user instance to run in. Each container is allocated CPU and memory resources, but the processes all run through the native OS kernel.

These containers may run slightly different OS distributions but cannot run guest OSs of different types (you could not run Windows or Ubuntu in a RedHat Linux container, for instance). Alternatively, the containers might run separate application processes, in which case, the variables and libraries required by the application process are added to the container.

One of the best-known container virtualization products is Docker ([docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)). Containerization is also being widely used to implement corporate workspaces on mobile devices![](Pasted%20image%2020230925170229.png)


# VM Resource Requirements
----
To deploy a client-side virtualization workstation, you must identify the **resource requirements** of the hypervisor and of each guest that you plan to install.

### CPU and Virtualization Extensions

CPU vendors have built special instruction sets to improve virtualization performance. The Intel technology for this is called "VT-x" (Virtualization Technology), while AMD calls it "AMD-V." Most virtualization products also benefit from a processor feature called "Second Level Address Translations" (SLAT), which improves the performance of virtual memory when multiple VMs are installed. Intel implements SLAT as a feature called "Extended Page Table" (EPT), and AMD calls it "Rapid Virtualization Indexing" (RVI).

Most virtualization software requires a CPU with virtualization support enabled, and even if there is no formal requirement, performance of the VMs will be impaired if hardware-assisted virtualization is not available. Some cheaper CPU models ship without the feature, and it may be disabled in the system firmware. If specifying a computer that will be used for virtualization, check the CPU specification carefully to confirm that it supports Intel VT-x or AMD-V and SLAT and verify that these features are enabled via system setup.

Apart from virtualization extensions, multiple CPU resources—whether through multiple physical processors, multi-core, or HyperThreading—will greatly benefit performance, especially if more than one guest OS is run concurrently.

*If the hypervisor is running in a 64-bit environment, 32-bit guest OSs can still be installed, providing the hypervisor supports them. However, 32-bit hypervisors will not support 64-bit guest OSs.*

### System Memory

Each guest OS requires sufficient system memory over and above what is required by the host OS/hypervisor. For example, it is recommended that Windows 10 be installed on a computer with at least 2 GB memory. This means that the virtualization workstation must have at least 4 GB RAM to run the host and a single Windows 10 guest OS. If you want to run multiple guest OSs concurrently, the resource demands can quickly add up. If the VMs are only used for development and testing, then performance might not be critical, and you may be able to specify less memory.

### Mass Storage

Each guest OS also takes up a substantial amount of disk space. The VM's "hard disk" is stored as an image file on the host. Most hypervisors use a dynamically expanding image format that only takes up space on the host as files are added to the guest OS. Even so, a typical Windows installation might require 20 GB. More space is required if you want to preserve snapshots (the state of a disk at a particular point in time). This is useful if you want to be able to roll back changes you make to the VM during a session.

*In an enterprise environment, you need not be constrained by the local disk resources on the host. Disk images could be stored in a high-speed storage area network (SAN).*

### Networking

A hypervisor will be able to create a virtual network environment through which all the VMs can communicate and a network shared by the host and by VMs on the same host and on other hosts. Enterprise virtual platforms allow the configuration of virtual switches and routers.

# VM Security Requirements
----
Like any computing technology, deploying a virtualization solution comes with **security requirements** and challenges.

### Guest OS Security

Each guest OS must be patched and protected against malware like any other OS. Patching each VM individually has performance implications, so in most environments, a new template image would be patched and tested then deployed to the production environment. Running security software (antivirus and intrusion prevention) on each guest OS can cause performance problems. Virtualization-specific solutions for running security applications through the host or hypervisor are available.

*Ordinary antivirus software installed on the host will NOT detect viruses infecting the guest OS. Scanning the virtual disks of a guest OS from the host could cause serious performance problems.*

The process of developing, testing, and deploying VM template images brings about the first major security concern with the virtual platform itself: rogue VMs (one that has been installed without authorization). The uncontrolled deployment of more and more VMs is referred to as virtual machine sprawl (VM sprawl).

System management software can be deployed to detect rogue builds. More generally, the management procedures for developing and deploying machine images need to be tightly drafted and monitored. VMs should conform to an application-specific template with the minimum configuration needed to run that application (that is, not running unnecessary services). Images should not be developed or stored in any sort of environment where they could be infected by malware or have any sort of malicious code inserted. One of the biggest concerns here is of rogue developers or contractors installing backdoors or "logic bombs" within a machine image.

### Host Security

Another key security vulnerability in a virtual platform is that the host represents a single point of failure for multiple guest OS instances. For example, if the host loses power, three or four guest VMs and the application services they are running will suddenly go offline.

### Hypervisor Security

Apart from ensuring the security of each guest OS and the host machine itself, the hypervisor must also be monitored for security vulnerabilities and exploits. Another issue is virtual machine escaping (VM escaping). This refers to malware running on a guest OS jumping to another guest or to the host. As with any other type of software, it is vital to keep the hypervisor code up to date with patches for critical vulnerabilities.


# REVIEW
----


1. What is a Type 2 hypervisor?

Hypervisor software that must be installed as an application running on a host OS. A Type 1 (or bare metal) hypervisor is installed directly to the host hardware.

2. You need to provision a virtualization workstation to run four guest OSs simultaneously. Each VM requires 2 GB system RAM. Is an 8 GB workstation sufficient to meet this requirement?

No. The host OS and/or hypervisor also requires system memory. If the host also a 2 GB requirement, you would only be able to launch three of the VMs simultaneously.

3. What is the main security requirement of a virtualization workstation configured to operate VMs within a sandbox?

A sandbox means that the VM environment should be isolated from the host and from other VM environments. A sandbox is often used to investigate malware. If the sandbox is secure, the malware can be executed and observed without the risk of it spreading to other systems (VM escaping).
