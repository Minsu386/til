The cloud makes almost any type of IT infrastructure available for use over the Internet with pay-per-use billing. Most companies make use of at least one cloud service, and many have moved all of what used to be on-premises server roles to the cloud. In this topic, you will learn to summarize cloud deployment and service models. This will help you to support cloud-connected networks and provide informed advice and support to your users.

# Cloud Deployment Models
----
A cloud can be provisioned using various ownership and access arrangements. These cloud deployment models can be broadly categorized as follows:

- **Public (or multitenant)** is a service offered over the Internet by cloud service providers (CSPs) to cloud consumers, often referred to as tenants. With this model, a CSP can offer subscriptions or pay-as-you-go financing or even provide lower-tier services free of charge. As a shared resource, there are risks regarding performance and security. Multicloud architectures are where the consumer organization uses services from more than one CSP.
- **Private** is cloud infrastructure that is completely private to and owned by the organization. In this case, there is likely to be one business unit dedicated to managing the cloud, while other business units make use of it. With private cloud computing, organizations can exercise greater control over the privacy and security of their services. This type of delivery method is geared more toward banking and governmental services that require strict access control in their operations.
- **Community** is where several organizations share the costs of either a hosted private or fully private cloud. This is usually done to pool resources for a common concern, such as standardization and security policies.
- **Hybrid** is a cloud computing solution that implements some sort of hybrid public/private/community. For example, a travel organization may run a sales website for most of the year using a private cloud but "break out" the solution to a public cloud at times when much higher utilization is forecast. As another example, a hybrid deployment may be used to provide some functions via a public cloud but keep sensitive or regulated infrastructure, applications, and data on-premises.



# Common Cloud Service Models
----
As well as the deployment model—public, private, hybrid, or community—cloud service models are often differentiated on the level of complexity and preconfiguration provided. Some of the most common models are infrastructure, software, platform, and desktop.

### Infrastructure as a Service

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** is a means of provisioning IT resources, such as servers, load balancers, and storage area network (SAN) components, quickly. Rather than purchase these components and the Internet links they require, you deploy them as needed from the service provider's datacenter. Examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)), Microsoft® Azure® Virtual Machines ([azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/)), and OpenStack® ([openstack.org](https://www.openstack.org/)). 

### Software as a Service

**Software as a service (SaaS)** is a different model of provisioning software applications. Rather than purchasing software licenses for a given number of seats, a business would access software hosted on a supplier's servers on a pay-as-you-go arrangement. Virtual infrastructure allows developers to provision on-demand applications much more quickly than previously. The applications can be developed and tested in the cloud without the need to test and deploy on client computers. Examples include Microsoft 365® ([support.office.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office?ui=en-us)), Salesforce® ([salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/)), and Google Workspace™ ([workspace.google.com](https://workspace.google.com/)).

### Platform as a Service

**Platform as a service (PaaS)** provides resources somewhere between SaaS and IaaS. A typical PaaS solution would deploy servers and storage network infrastructure (as per IaaS) but also provide a multi-tier web application/database platform on top. This platform could be based on Oracle® or MS SQL or PHP and MySQL™. Examples include Oracle Database ([cloud.oracle.com/paas](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/)), Microsoft Azure SQL Database ([azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/database/)), and Google App Engine™ ([cloud.google.com/appengine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)).

As distinct from SaaS though, this platform would not be configured to run an application. Your own developers would have to create the software (the sales contact or e‑commerce application) that runs using the platform. The service provider would be responsible for the integrity and availability of the platform components, but you would be responsible for the security of the application you created on the platform.

# Cloud Characteristics
----
**Cloud characteristics** are the features that distinguish a cloud provisioning model from on-premises or hosted client/server network architecture.

From the consumer point of view, cloud computing is a service that provides on-demand resources—server instances, file storage, databases, or applications—over a network, typically the Internet. The service is a cloud because the end user is not aware of or responsible for any details of the procurement, implementation, or management of the infrastructure that underpins those resources. The end user is interested in and pays for only the services provided by the cloud. The per-use billing for resources consumed by the cloud is referred to as **metered utilization**. The metering measurement is based on the type of resource such as storage, processing, bandwidth, or active users. The metering mechanism should be accessible to the customer via a reporting dashboard, providing complete transparency in usage and billing.

From the provider point of view, provisioning a cloud is like provisioning any other type of large-scale datacenter. Cloud computing almost always uses one or more methods of virtualization to ensure that resources are reliably and quickly provisioned to the client who requires them.

Among other benefits, the cloud provides high availability, scalability, and elasticity:

- High availability (HA) means that the service experiences very little downtime. For example, a service with "Five Nines" or 99.999% availability experiences only 5 minutes and 15 seconds annual downtime. Downtime can occur as a result of scheduled maintenance and unexpected outages.
- Scalability means that the costs involved in supplying the service to more users are linear. For example, if the number of users doubles in a scalable system, the costs to maintain the same level of service would also double (or less than double). If costs more than double, the system is less scalable. Scalability can be achieved by adding nodes (horizontal/scaling out) or by adding resources to each node (vertical/scaling up).
- **Rapid elasticity** refers to the system's ability to handle changes to demand in real time. A system with high elasticity will not experience loss of service or performance if demand suddenly doubles (or triples, or quadruples). Conversely, it may be important for the system to be able to reduce costs when demand is low.

To meet availability, scalability, and elasticity requirements, cloud providers must be able to provision and deprovision resources automatically. This is achieved through pooling of **shared resources** and virtualization. Pooling of shared resources means that the hardware making up the cloud provider's datacenter is not dedicated or reserved to a single customer account. The layers of virtualization used in the cloud architecture allow the provider to provision more CPU, memory, disk, or network resource using management software, rather than (for instance) having to go to the datacenter floor, unplug a server, add a memory module, and reboot.

# Desktop Virtualization
----
**Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)** refers to using VMs as a means of provisioning corporate desktops. In a typical **desktop virtualization** solution, desktop computers are replaced by low-spec thin client computers.

When the thin client starts, it boots a minimal OS, allowing the user to log on to a VM stored on the company server or cloud infrastructure. The user makes a connection to the VM using some sort of remote desktop protocol, such as Microsoft Remote Desktop or Citrix ICA. The thin client must locate the correct image and use an appropriate authentication mechanism. There may be a 1:1 mapping based on machine name or IP address, or the process of finding an image may be handled by a connection broker.

All application processing and data storage in the virtual desktop environment (VDE) or workspace is performed by the server. The thin client computer need only be powerful enough to display the screen image, play audio, and transfer mouse, key commands and video, and audio information over the network.

The virtualization server hosting the virtual desktops can be provisioned either as an **on-premises server** (on the same local network as the clients) or in the **cloud**. This centralization of data makes it easier to back up. The desktop VMs are easier to support and troubleshoot. They are better locked against unsecure user practices because any changes to the VM can easily be overwritten from the template image. With VDI, it is also easier for a company to completely offload their IT infrastructure to a third-party services company.

The main disadvantage is that during a failure in the server and network infrastructure, users have no local processing ability. This can mean that downtime events may be more costly in terms of lost productivity.
