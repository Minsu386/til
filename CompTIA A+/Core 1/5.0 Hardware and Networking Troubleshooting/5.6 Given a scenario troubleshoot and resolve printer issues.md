Users often need to print documents urgently. When the print process fails, it can cause a great deal of disruption. Users will look to you to identify and resolve their problems quickly, so you will need to recognize common issues and to correct them efficiently when they occur.

# Printer Connectivity Issues
----
A printer connectivity issue might arise either because the device cannot be located when trying to install it or because the OS reports an installed device as offline or unavailable.

In many cases there will be an error message or code displayed on the print device’s control panel. You may need to look the error code up in the printer documentation to confirm what it means. In the absence of any error code or descriptive error log, remember to test obvious things first:

- Verify that the printer is switched on and online. A printer can be taken offline quite easily by pressing the button on the control panel. Often this happens by accident. A printer may also go offline because it is waiting for user intervention, it has detected a network error, or because it has received corrupt print job data.
- Check that all components and cartridges are correctly installed, that all service panels are closed, and that at least one tray is loaded with paper.
- Print a test page using the printer's control panel. If this works, the issue lies with the connection to the computer/network.
- Cycle the power on the print device. If this does not solve the issue, consider performing a factory reset.
- Inspect the USB/Ethernet cable and connectors. Consider replacing with a known good cable to test for a cable or connector problem. If possible, attempt a different connection type. For example, if a wireless printer is not detected, try connecting to a computer via USB or using an Ethernet cable.

*Remember to ask: "What has changed?" It is important to establish whether something has never worked or has just stopped working. If something never worked, then there has been an installation error; if something has stopped working, look for a configuration change or maintenance issue.*



# Print Feed Issues
----
f there is connectivity with the print device but multiple jobs do not print, there is likely to be a mechanical problem with the printer.

### Paper Jam Issues

A **paper jam** is where a sheet of paper becomes lodged somewhere in the paper path. Fixing a paper jam is usually quite straightforward. The key point is to gain proper access to the stuck page. Do not use force to try to remove a sheet as you may cause further damage. Most sheets will pull free from most parts of the printer, but if a page is stuck in the fuser unit of a laser printer, you must use the release levers to get it out. Pulling the paper forcibly through the fuser can damage the rollers and, if the paper rips, leave paper debris on them.

If paper jams are frequent, you need to diagnose the problem rather than simply fix the symptom each time. Most paper jams arise because the media (paper or labels) are not suitable for the printer or because a sheet is creased, folded, or not loaded properly in the tray. There could be a problem with a roller too. Identify whether or not the jam occurs in the same place each time, and take appropriate preventive maintenance (clean or replace the part).

*If the media and pickup rollers are good and if the jam occurs within the drum assembly but before the image is fused, the cause could be a faulty static eliminator. Normally, this part removes the high static charge from the paper as it leaves the transfer unit. If the strip fails, the paper may stick to the drum or curl as it enters the fuser unit.*

With an inkjet, it is usually easy to see exactly where the paper has jammed. If the sheet will not come out easily, do not just try to pull it harder—check the instruction manual to find out how to release any components that might prevent you from removing the paper.

### Paper Feed Issues

If paper is **not feeding** into the printer or if the printer is **feeding multiple sheets** at the same time, make the following checks:

- Verify that the **paper size and weight is compatible** with the options allowed for the print tray and that it is loaded in the tray properly with the media guides set properly.
- Check that the paper is not creased, damp, or dirty.

*Fan the edge of a paper stack with your thumb to separate the sheets before loading the tray. Do not overdo this, however—you can generate a static charge that will hold the sheets together.*

- If you can discount a media problem, try changing the pickup rollers. In a laser printer, these are part of the maintenance kit.

### Grinding Noise Issues

On a laser printer, a **grinding noise** indicates a problem with the toner cartridge, fuser, or other gears/rollers. Try to identify the specific source of the noise. Check all components to ensure they are seated correctly. Check the paper path carefully for jams and debris. If this does not solve the issue, replace either the printer cartridge or maintenance kit (or both).

On an inkjet, a grinding noise typically indicates a fault in the carriage mechanism. Check the vendor documentation for tips on re-engaging the clutch mechanism with the gear that moves the cartridge.

# Print Quality Issues
----
If a job prints but the output is smudged, faded, or arrives with unusual marks (print defects), the problem is likely to be a printer hardware or media fault. The causes of print defects tend to be specific to the technology used by the imaging process. Always consult the manufacturer's documentation and troubleshooting notes.

### Laser Printer Print Defects

The following defects are common in laser printers:

- **Faded or faint prints**—If a simple cause such as the user choosing an option for low density (draft output) can be discounted, this is most likely to indicate that the toner cartridge needs replacing.
- **Blank pages**—This is usually an application or driver problem, but it could indicate that a toner cartridge has been installed without removing its packing seals. Alternatively, if these simple causes can be discounted, this could also be a sign that the transfer roller is damaged (the image transfer stage fails).
- **White stripes**—This indicates either that the toner is poorly distributed (give the cartridge a gentle shake) or that the transfer roller is dirty or damaged.
- **Black stripes or whole page black**—This indicates that the primary charge roller is dirty or damaged or that the high voltage power supply to the developer unit is malfunctioning. Try printing with a known good toner cartridge.
- **Speckling on output**—Loose toner may be getting onto the paper. Clean the inside of the printer using an approved toner vacuum.
- **Vertical or horizontal lines**—Marks that appear in the same place (referred to as repetitive defects) are often due to dirty feed rollers (note that there are rollers in the toner cartridge and fuser unit too) or a damaged or dirty photosensitive drum.
- **Toner not fused to paper**—Output that smudges easily indicates that the fuser needs replacing.
- **Double/echo images**—This is a sign that the photosensitive drum has not been cleaned properly. The drum is smaller than the size of a sheet of paper, so if the latent image is not completely cleared, it will repeat as a light "ghost" or dark "shadow" image farther down the page. Images may also appear from previous prints. Try printing a series of different images, and see if the problem resolves itself. If not, replace the drum/toner cartridge.
- **Incorrect chroma display**—If prints come out in the wrong color (for example, if the whole print has a magenta tint), ensure that the toner cartridges have been installed in the correct location (for instance, that a magenta cartridge hasn't been installed in the cyan slot). Also ensure that there is sufficient toner in each cartridge. If there is a cast or shadow-like effect, the transfer belt or one or all of the cartridges or rollers are probably misaligned. Try reseating them, and then run the printer calibration utility and print a test page to verify the problem is solved.
- **Color missing**—If a color is completely missing, try replacing the cartridge. If this does not solve the issue, clean the contacts between the printer and cartridge.

### Inkjet Print Defects

Lines running through printouts indicate a dirty print head or blocked ink nozzle, which can usually be fixed by running a cleaning cycle. Most other print quality problems (output that smears easily, wavy or wrinkled output, or blurry output) is likely to be a media problem. As with laser printers, persistent marks on output probably indicate a dirty feed roller. If the print head jams, the printer will probably display a status message or show a flashing LED. Try turning the printer off and unplugging it, then turning it back on. Inconsistent color output indicates that one of the ink reservoirs is running low (or that a print head for one of the color cartridges is completely blocked). If a document does not print in color, check that color printing has been selected.

### Dot Matrix Print Defects

Lines in dot matrix printer output indicate a stuck pin in the print head. Output can also be affected by the platen position. The platen adjusts the gap between the paper and the print head to accommodate different paper types. Incorrect adjustment of the platen gap can cause faint printing (gap too wide) or smudging (too narrow).

# Finishing Issues
----
A **finisher** unit can be installed on laser printers and MFDs to perform various functions, including stapling the pages of a print job or punching holes in the sheets so that they can be placed in a binder. The printer settings must be configured to select the finisher as an installed output option.

- **Incorrect page orientation**—The paper size and orientation must be set correctly for the print job or the finishing/binding will be aligned to the wrong edge. It can be tricky for users to paginate the source document and select the correct output options, especially when using a booklet print option to apply staples to the middle of the sheet. The icon in the printing preferences dialog will show which edge is selected for binding. Test settings on a short document first.

	![](../../../Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231003064420.png)

- **Hole punch**—The main issue with hole punching is exceeding the maximum number of sheets. This can cause the finishing unit to jam. Make sure print jobs are sent in batches of less than the maximum permissible sheet count for the finisher unit. Be aware that the maximum number of sheets may depend on the paper weight (sheet thickness).
- **Staple jam**—An excessive number of sheets is also the primary cause of staple jams. One staple will become bent and stuck within the punch mechanism. Remove the staple cartridge, and release the catch at the end to allow removal of stuck staples.


# Print Job Issues
----
If there is no hardware or media issue, investigate the OS print queue and driver settings.

### Print Monitors

In Windows, display and print functions for compatible applications are usually handled by the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) subsystem. A WPF print job is formatted using the PDL and spooled in the logical printer's spool folder within %SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Printers\.

The print monitor transmits the print job to the printer and provides status information. If a problem is encountered during printing, the print device sends a status message back to the print monitor, which displays a desktop notification.

If the print device is accessed over the network, a redirector service on the local computer passes the print job from the locally spooled file to the spooler on the print server. The print server then transmits it to the print device.

### Print Queue and Spooler Troubleshooting

A backed-up print queue means that there are **multiple prints pending** but not printing. This might occur because the print device is offline or out of paper or ink/toner. It could also occur because of an error processing a particular print job.

In Windows, go to Windows **Settings** to access the printer and open its print queue. Try restarting the job (right-click the document name and select **Restart**). If that does not work, delete the print job, and try printing it again.

![](../../../Meta/Pasted%20image%2020231003064455.png)

If you cannot delete a job (if the print queue is backed up or stalled), you will need to stop and restart the Print **Spooler** service.

*The same steps apply to a shared printer. The server’s print queue will hold jobs from multiple users.*

### Garbled Print Issues

A **garbled print** is one where the print device emits many pages with a few characters on each or many blank pages. This typically occurs because of a fault in rendering the print job somewhere in the path between the application, printer driver, page description language, and print device. To discount a transitory error, cancel the print job, clear the print queue, cycle the power on the printer (leaving it off for 30 seconds to clear the memory), and try to print again.

Use the OS to print a test page. If the test page prints successfully, then the problem is related to the print function of a particular application. Try printing a different file from the same application; if this works, then you know that the problem is specific to a particular file. If the test page does not print, try using the printer's control panel to print a test page directly from the device. If this works, there is some sort of communication problem between the print device and Windows.

If the problem persists, update the printer driver, and check that the printer is set to use a PDL (PCL or PostScript) that is supported by the source application.

If the characters in a document are different from those expected or if strange characters appear in an otherwise normal print, check that fonts specified in the document are available on the PC and/or printer. The software application should indicate whether the specified font is available or whether it is substituting it for the nearest match.

# Review
----
1. A user reports that the printed output is not up to the usual standards for her printer. You will need to resolve this issue so she can print her report. What is the overall process for troubleshooting this issue?

Print out a test page to see if you can reproduce the problem the user reported. If you see the same problem as reported by the user, identify the print defect, based on the type of printer, to resolve the problem. Document the steps you took to resolve the problem.

2. **How would you track down the source of a paper jam?**

Check the error message reported by the printer (this may be shown on the printer's console). It may indicate the location of the stuck pages. Otherwise, visually inspect the various feed and output mechanisms.

3. Paper is repeatedly jamming in an inkjet printer. What could be causing this?

The paper might not be loaded squarely, there might be too much paper loaded into the tray, or the paper is creased or dirty.

4. A laser printer is producing white stripes on the paper. What could be causing this?

Poorly distributed toner or a damaged/worn transfer corona wire. If the secondary corona does not apply a charge evenly across the paper, less toner is attracted from the drum to the part of the sheet where charging failed. Note that if there are repetitive white or black marks (rather than stripes) that do not smudge, the issue is more likely to be dirt or grease on the drum.

5. **What effect does a dirty primary charge roller have on laser printing?**

It leaves black stripes on the paper. If the roller does not apply the correct charge evenly to the drum, toner is attracted to the place where the charging failed, creating a black stripe all the way down the page.

6. You have been asked to perform basic maintenance on an inkjet printer. One of the users noticed that the colors are not printing correctly and that the bottom of some letters are not printing. What would you do?

Try using the printer's built-in cleaning cycle and then replacing the ink cartridge. If these do not work, try using an aftermarket cleaning product. Try using the printer properties sheet to check for print head alignment, color settings, and other settings.

7. **If print jobs do not appear at the printer and the queue is clear, what could you try first to solve the problem?**

Cycle the power on the printer.
