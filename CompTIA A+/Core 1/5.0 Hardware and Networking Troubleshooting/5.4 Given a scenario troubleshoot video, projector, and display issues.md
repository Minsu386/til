# Troubleshoot Missing Video Issues
----
If no image is displayed on the monitor or projector, first make sure that the display device is plugged in and turned on. Check that the monitor is not in standby mode (press a key or cycle the power to the monitor to activate it).

You may also need to use controls on the monitor itself to adjust the image or select the **appropriate data source** or input channel. For example, if there is no image on the screen, check that the monitor is set to use the HDMI port that the computer is connected to, rather than an empty DVI port. These on-screen display (OSD) menus are operated using buttons on the monitor case. As well as input control, you can usually find settings for brightness, color/contrast, and power saving. 

### Physical Cabling Issues

If the display is powered on and you can rule out a problem with the input source, check the **cable and connectors** between the video card and monitor. Make sure the cable is connected securely at both ends and is not loose. Make sure that the cable has not become stretched or crimped. Verify that the cable specification is valid for the application. For example, a basic HDMI cable might not be sufficient quality for 4K resolution, which requires High Speed rated cable.

*To rule out cable problems, use the “known good” technique and substitute with another cable. Alternatively, try the monitor with a different PC to identify whether the problem is with the display unit or with the input source.*

### Burned-Out-Bulb Issues

A video projector is a large-format display, suitable for use in a presentation or at a meeting. The image is projected onto a screen or wall using a lens system. Like display monitors, projectors can use different imaging technologies, such as cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), and digital light processing (DLP). Where a PC monitor display uses a small backlight or LED array, a projector uses a very strong bulb light source to project the image onto a screen or backdrop.

Projector bulbs have a limited lifetime and will often need to be replaced. You might notice the image generated by the projector start to dim. There may also be a bulb health warning indicator light. A completely failed bulb is referred to as a **burned-out bulb**. You might hear the bulb “pop” and observe scorch marks on the inside or a broken filament.

*Take care when handling projectors. During use, the bulb becomes very hot, and while it is hot, it will be very fragile. Allow a projector to cool completely before attempting to remove it.*

### Intermittent Projector Shutdown Issues

**Intermittent projector shutdown** is typically caused by overheating. Check that the projector’s fan is working, that the vents are free from dust and are not obstructed, and that the ambient temperature is not too high. If you can rule out overheating, check for loose connector cables and verify that the bulb is secured properly.

# Troubleshoot Video Quality Issues
----
There might be an image on the display unit, but it might exhibit unusual artefacts or glitches. These video quality issues might be due to a fault in the display itself or with the input source (the signal from the video card).

- **Dim image**—Use the OSD to check the brightness and contrast controls to make sure they are not turned all the way down. It is possible that a power-saving mode is dimming the display. It is also possible that an adaptive brightness, auto-brightness, or eye-saving feature of the device or operating system has been enabled. These reduce brightness and contrast and can use lower blue-light levels. This type of feature might activate automatically at a certain time of day or could use an ambient light sensor to trigger when the room is dark. If the image is almost invisible, the display’s backlight has probably failed, and the unit will have to be repaired under warranty or replaced.
- **Fuzzy image**—If the output resolution does not match the display device’s native resolution, the image will appear fuzzy. This typically happens if the video card’s driver is faulty or incorrectly configured. For example, the TFT monitor’s resolution might be 1920x1080, but the video card is set to 1024x768. Use the OS to change the output resolution or update the driver.
- **Flashing screen**—Check the video cable and connectors. If the connector is not securely inserted at both ends, this could cause flickering. A flickering or flashing image could also be caused by the display’s backlight or circuitry starting to fail. Other symptoms of a failing display include bright or dim bands or lines and bright spots at the edge of the screen. Any of these symptoms will typically require the display to be repaired under warranty or replaced.

*A flashing screen could also be caused by a faulty or overheating video card. Attach the display device to a different computer to isolate the cause of the issue.*

- **Dead pixels**—Defects in a flat-panel monitor may cause individual pixels to be "stuck" or "dead." If a digital display panel has stuck (constantly bright) pixels, and the panel cannot be replaced under warranty, there are software utilities available to cycle the pixel through a series of relatively extreme color states to try to reactivate it. Fixed pixels can also sometimes be reactivated by gently pressing or tapping the affected area of the screen with a stylus or pencil eraser, though there is the risk of causing further damage or scratching the screen. Dead pixels (solid black) cannot usually be fixed.
- **Burn-in**—When the same static image is displayed for an extended period, the monitor's picture elements can be damaged, and a ghost image is "burned" permanently onto the display. Devices such as plasma screens and organic LED (OLED) displays can be more vulnerable to burn-in than ordinary TFT/LED displays. Always ensure that a display is set to turn off, or use an animated screen saver when no user input is detected.

*A TFT/LED monitor uses an LED backlight to illuminate the image. In an OLED, each pixel provides its own illumination.*

- **Incorrect color display**—If a computer is used to produce digital art, it is very important that the display be calibrated to scanning devices and print output. Color calibration (or workflow) refers to a process of adjusting screen and scanner settings so that color input and output are balanced. Color settings should be configured with the assistance of a color profile. You can use the Color Management applet in Control Panel along with test card color patterns and spectrophotometers to define a color profile and verify that the display matches it.

You may also come across color glitches, such as purple or green horizontal lines or colors changing unexpectedly. These are usually caused by a faulty or loose connector or cabling that is either faulty or insufficient quality for the current image resolution. Try replacing the cable. If this does not fix the issue, there could be a hardware fault in either the monitor or graphics adapter.

- **Audio issues**—HDMI and DisplayPort can deliver a combined video and audio signal if that is supported by the video card. DVI and VGA cannot carry a sound signal, so the speakers must be connected to the computer’s audio ports using 3.5mm jacks. If there is no sound from built-in or separate speakers, check power, cables/connectors, and any physical volume control on the speaker device. If you can discount these issues, use the OS to verify that the audio output is set to the correct device and check the OS volume control.




# Review
----
1.  You receive a support call from a lecturer. A projector is only displaying a very dim image. Which component should you prioritize for investigation?

	A dim image is likely to be caused by a blow bulb (or one that is about to blow). If there is no visible sign of damage to the bulb, you should rule out a simple configuration issue, such as the brightness control being turned all the way down.


2. user has been supplied with a monitor from stores as a temporary replacement. However, the user reports that the device is unusable because of a thick green band across the middle of the screen. What technique could you use to diagnose the cause?
	Replace the cable with a known good one. If this does not solve the problem, suspect an issue with the monitor. As the PC was used with no issues with another monitor, there is not likely to be an issue with the video card.
