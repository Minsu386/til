Troubleshooting a PC that will not boot is one of the most common tasks for a PC technician to undertake. You need to diagnose causes relating to power, motherboard components, or disk issues from common symptoms.

Problems with disks and storage systems can have impacts beyond just booting the computer. End users rely on the storage devices in their PCs to store important system information and personal or professional data and files. Without a storage device that works properly, the computer system is essentially worthless. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you will likely be called upon to fix or troubleshoot common problems with HDDs, SSDs, and other storage devices.


# Troubleshoot Boot Issues
----
Once the POST tests are complete, the firmware searches for devices as specified in the boot sequence. If the first device in the sequence is not found, the system attempts to boot from the next device. For example, if there is no fixed disk, the boot sequence checks for a USB-attached drive. If no disk-based boot device is found, the system might attempt to boot from the network. If no boot device is found, the system displays an error message and halts the boot process.

If the system attempts to boot from an incorrect device, check that the removable drives do not contain media that are interfering with the boot process and that the boot device order is correctly configured.

If a fixed disk is not detected at boot, try to check that it is powering up. Drive activity is usually indicated by an LED on the front panel of the system unit case. If this is inactive, check that the drive has a power connector attached. If the PC has no LEDs, or you suspect that they may be faulty, it is usually possible to hear a hard disk spinning up. Once you have determined that the drive is powering up, try the following:

- Check that data cables are not damaged and that they are correctly connected to the drive.
- If the drives are connected to a motherboard port, check that it has not been disabled by a jumper or via system setup.

### Troubleshoot Boot Sector Issues

If you can rule out issues with power and cabling, suspect an issue with the device’s boot sector and files. Corruption due to faults in the disk unit, power failure, incorrect installation of multiple operating systems, or malware will prevent the disk from working as a boot device. There are two ways of formatting the boot information: MBR and GPT.

- In the legacy master boot record (MBR) scheme, the MBR is in the first sector of the first partition. Partitions allow a single disk device to be divided into multiple logical drives. The first sector contains information about the partitions on the disk plus some code that points to the location of the active boot sector. The boot sector is located either on the sector after the MBR or the first sector of each other partition. It describes the partition file system and contains the code that points to the method of booting the OS. Typically, this will be the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store for a Windows system or GRUB or LILO Linux boot managers. Each primary partition can contain a boot sector, but only one of them can be marked active.
- With the modern globally unique ID (GUID) partition table (GPT) boot scheme, the boot information is not restricted to a single sector but still serves the same basic purpose of identifying partitions and OS boot loaders.

Whether the disk is using an MBR or GPT partitioning scheme, damage to these records results in boot errors such as “**Boot device not found**,” "OS not found," or "Invalid drive specification." If this problem has been caused by malware, the best way to resolve it is to use the boot disk option in your antivirus software. This will include a scanner that may detect the malware that caused the problem in the first place and contain tools to repair the boot sector.

If you don't have the option of using a recovery disk created by the antivirus software, you can try to use the repair options that come with the OS setup disk.




# Troubleshoot Drive Availability
----

A hard disk drive (HDD) is most likely to fail due to mechanical problems either in the first few months of operation or after a few years. A solid-state drive (SSD) is typically more reliable but also has a maximum expected lifetime. With any fixed disk, sudden loss of power can cause damage and/or file corruption, especially if power loss occurs in the middle of a write operation.

A fixed disk that is failing might display the following symptoms:

- Unusual noise (HDD only)—A healthy hard disk makes a certain low-level noise when accessing the platters. A loud or **grinding noise**, or any sort of **clicking sound**, is a sign of a mechanical problem.
- No **LED status indicator** activity—If disk activity lights are not active, the whole system might not be receiving power, or the individual disk unit could be faulty.
- **Constant LED activity**—Constant activity, often referred to as disk thrashing, can be a sign that there is not enough system RAM so that the disk is being used continually for paging (virtual memory). It could also be a sign of a faulty software process or that the system is infected with malware.
- **Bootable device not found**—If the PC fails to boot from the fixed disk, it is either faulty or there is file corruption.
- **Missing drives in OS**—If the system boots, but a second fixed disk or removable drive does not appear in tools such as File Explorer or cannot be accessed via the command-line, first check that it has been initialized and formatted with a partition structure and file system. If the disk is not detected by a configuration tool such as Windows Disk Management, suspect that it has a hardware or cable/connector fault.
- **Read/write failure**—This means that when you are trying to open or save a file, an error message such as "Cannot read from the source disk" is displayed. On an HDD, this is typically caused by **bad sectors**. A sector can be damaged through power failure or a mechanical fault. If you run a test utility, such as chkdsk, and more bad sectors are located each time the test is run, it is a sign that the disk is about to fail. On an SSD, the cause will be one or more bad blocks. SSD circuitry degrades over the course of many write operations. An SSD is manufactured with “spare” blocks and uses wear leveling routines to compensate for this. If the spare blocks are all used up, the drive firmware will no longer be able to compensate for ones that have failed.
- **Blue screen of death (BSOD)**—A failing fixed disk and file corruption may cause a particularly severe read/write failure, resulting in a system stop error (a crash screen).

When experiencing any of these symptoms, try to make a data backup and replace the disk as soon as possible to minimize the risk of data loss.

# Troubleshoot Drive Reliability and Performance
----

In addition to symptoms that you can detect by observing system operation, most fixed disks have a self-diagnostic program called **Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART)**. SMART can alert the operating system if a **failure** is detected. If you suspect that a drive is failing or if you experience performance issues such as **extended read/write times**, you should try to run more advanced diagnostic tests on the drive. Most fixed disk vendors supply utilities for testing drives, or there may be a system diagnostics program supplied with the computer system.

You can also use Windows utilities to query SMART and run manual tests.

These tests can detect whether there is any damage to the device’s storage mechanisms. In the case of performance, they can report statistics such as **input/output operations per second (IOPS)**. If performance is reduced from the vendor’s baseline measurements under test conditions, it is likely that the device itself is faulty. If performance metrics are similar to the device’s benchmark under test conditions, any slow read/write access observed during operation is likely to be due to a more complex system performance issue. Possible causes include application load and general system resource issues, file fragmentation (on hard disks), and limited remaining capacity.

Extended read/write times can also occur because particular sectors (HDDs) or blocks (SSDs) fail (go “bad”). **Data loss/corruption** means that files stored in these locations cannot be opened or simply disappear. When bad sectors or blocks are detected, the disk firmware marks them as unavailable for use.

If there is file corruption on a hard disk and no backup, you can attempt to recover data from the device using a recovery utility.

# Troubleshoot RAID Failure
----

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is usually configured as a means of protecting data against the risk of a single fixed disk failing. The data is either copied to a second drive (mirroring) or additional information is recorded on multiple drives to enable them to recover from a device failure (parity). RAID can be implemented using hardware controllers or features of the operating system. The redundant storage is made available as a volume, which can be partitioned and formatted in the OS as one or more drives.

There are two main scenarios for **RAID failure**: failure of a device within the array and failure of the whole array or volume.

If one of the underlying devices fails, the volume will be listed as "degraded," but the data on the volume will still be accessible and it should continue to function as a boot device, if so configured.

*RAID 0 has no redundancy, so if one of the disks fails, the volume will stop working. RAID 0 only has specialist uses where speed is more important than reliability.*

Most desktop-level RAID solutions can tolerate the loss of only one disk, so it should be replaced as soon as possible. If the array supports hot swapping, then the new disk can simply be inserted into the chassis of the computer or into a disk chassis. Once this is done, the array can be rebuilt using the RAID configuration utility (if a hardware RAID controller is used) or an OS utility (if you are using software RAID). Note that the rebuilding process is likely to severely affect performance as the controller is probably writing multiple gigabytes of data to the new disk.

![](../../../Meta/Pasted%20image%2020230926082243.png)

*When hot swapping a faulty disk out, take extreme caution not to remove a healthy disk from the array as making a mistake could cause the array to fail, depending on the configuration. Disk failure is normally indicated by a red LED. Always make a backup beforehand.*

If a volume is not available, either more than the tolerated number of disks has failed, or the controller has failed. If the boot volume is affected, then the operating system will not start. If too many disks have failed, you will have to turn to the latest backup or try to use file recovery solutions. If the issue is controller failure, then data on the volume should be recoverable, though there may be file corruption if a write operation was interrupted by the failure. Either install a new controller or import the disks into another system.

If the failure affects the boot process, use the RAID configuration utility to verify its status. If you cannot access the configuration utility, then the controller itself is likely to have failed.

# REVIEW
----
1. **You have been servicing a computer, but when you have finished you find that it will not turn on. There was no power problem before, and you have verified that the computer is connected to a working electrical outlet. What is the most likely explanation?**

It is most likely that one or more power connectors have not been reconnected. Check the P1 motherboard connector, a 4-pin CPU connector, and all necessary SATA or Molex device connectors. Also, the cable connecting the power button to a motherboard header could have been disconnected.

2. **Additional memory was installed in a user's system, and now it will not boot. What steps would you take to resolve this job ticket?**

Use the vendor’s system setup guide to verify that the correct memory type was installed on the system and in the correct configuration (consider whether dual-channel memory was installed in the correct slots). Check that the new memory module is seated properly in its slot. Try swapping memory around in the memory slots.

3. **You are trying to install Windows from the setup disc, but the computer will not boot from the DVD. What should you do?**

Check that the boot order in system setup is set correctly. If the boot order is correct, check that the disc is not dirty or scratched. If the disc loads in another computer, check that the optical drive data and power cables are connected.

4. **Following a power cut, a user reports that their computer will not boot. The message “BCD missing" is shown on the screen. The computer does not store data that needs to be backed up. What is the best first step to try to resolve the issue?**

Use a system recovery disk to try to repair the disk drive’s boot information.

5. **A user reports that there is a loud clicking noise when she tries to save a file. What should be your first troubleshooting step?**

Determine whether a data backup has been made. If not, try to make one.

6. **You receive a support call from a user of one of the company’s computer-aided design (CAD) workstations. The user reports that a notification “RAID utility reports that the volume is degraded” is being displayed. A recent backup has been made. What should you do to try to restore the array?**

A degraded volume is still working but has lost one of its disks. In most RAID configurations, another disk failure would cause the volume to fail, so you should add a new disk as soon as possible (though do note that rebuilding the array will reduce performance).

7. **A user reports hearing noises from the hard disk—does this indicate it is failing and should be replaced?**

Not necessarily. Hard disks do make noises, but they are not all indicators of a problem. Question the user to find out what sort of noises are occurring or inspect the system yourself.
