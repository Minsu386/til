Part of your duties as a CompTIA A+ technician will be helping users when they encounter problems with their mobile devices. In this topic, you will troubleshoot mobile device hardware issues. 

# Power and Battery Issues
----
If you experience problems working from AC power, first test the outlet with a "known good" device (such as a lamp). Next, check that an LED on the AC adapter is green. If there is no LED, check the fuse on the plug, and if available, try testing with a known good adapter.

*Sometimes AC adapters can get mixed up. If an underpowered adapter is used—for example, a 65 W adapter is plugged into a 90 W system—the laptop will display a warning at boot time.*

If a mobile device will not power on when disconnected from building power, first check that the battery is seated properly in its compartment. Also check whether the battery contacts are dirty. You can clean them using swabs.

If the battery is properly inserted and the mobile device does not switch on or only remains on for a few seconds, it is most likely completely discharged. A battery exhibiting **poor health** will not hold a charge. This means that the battery is at the end of its useful life. You can test this by using a known good battery. If a known good battery does not work, then there is something wrong with the power circuitry on the motherboard.

While laptop batteries are replaceable, few smartphones or tablets come with removable battery packs. Most vendors try to design their devices so that they will support "typical" usage for a full day without charging. As the battery ages, it becomes less able to hold a full charge. If it is non-removable, the device will have to be returned to the vendor for battery replacement.

### Improper Charging Symptoms

Properly caring for the battery not only prolongs battery life but also mitigates health and safety risks. Use the battery charger provided by the manufacturer or an approved replacement charger. Using an incorrect battery charging cable or exposing a battery to extreme heat carries risks of fire or even explosion.

*Exercise caution when leaving batteries to recharge unattended (for example, overnight). Do not leave a battery charger close to flammable material, and ensure there is plenty of ventilation around the unit.*

An **improper charging** routine will reduce the usable life of a battery. Follow manufacturer instructions on the proper charging and discharging of the battery. Make use of power management features included with your device/OS to prolong battery life. A Li-ion battery should not be allowed to fully discharge regularly or be kept persistently at 100% charge, as this reduces battery life.

As batteries age, the maximum charge they can sustain decreases, so short battery life will usually indicate that the battery needs replacing. If the battery is not old or faulty, you could suspect that an app is putting excessive strain on the battery. You can use an app to check battery utilization.

### Swollen Battery Symptoms

If you notice any **swelling** from the battery compartment, discontinue use of the mobile device immediately. Signs that the battery has swollen can include a device that wobbles when placed flat on a desk or a deformed touchpad or keyboard. A swollen battery indicates some sort of problem with the battery's charging circuit, which is supposed to prevent overcharging. If a device is exposed to liquid, this could also have damaged the battery.

Li-ion batteries are designed to swell to avoid bursting or exploding, but great care must be taken when handling a swollen battery to avoid further damage. A swollen battery is a fire hazard and could leak hazardous chemicals—do not allow these to come into contact with your skin or your eyes. If the battery cannot be released safely and easily from its compartment, contact the manufacturer for advice. You should also contact the manufacturer for specific disposal instructions. A swollen battery should not be discarded via standard recycling points unless the facility confirms it can accept batteries in a potentially hazardous state.''

*Manufacturing defects in batteries and AC adapters often occur in batches. Make sure you remain signed up to the vendor's alerting service so that you are informed about any product recalls or safety advisories.*



# Hardware Failure Issues
----
Mobile devices are more susceptible to mechanical problems than most desktop PCs, so you should be alert to the symptoms of hardware failure.

### Overheating Symptoms

The compact design of mobile devices makes them vulnerable to **overheating**. The bottom surface of a laptop becomes hot when improperly ventilated. This can easily happen when laptops are put on soft surfaces, on people's laps, or in places where there is not enough room between the vents and a wall. Laptop cooling (or chiller) pads are accessories that are designed to sit under the laptop to maximize airflow and protect a user from getting a burn from a device overheating.

Dust trapped in vents acts as an insulator and can prevent proper cooling. Handheld devices use passive cooling and therefore can become quite warm when used intensively. High screen brightness and use of the flashlight function will rapidly increase heat. A mobile device will start to overheat quickly when exposed to direct sunlight. Devices have protective circuitry that will initiate a shut down if the internal temperature is at the maximum safe limit. You can also use an app to monitor the battery temperature, and then compare that to the operating limits. Generally speaking, approaching 40⁰C is getting too warm.

### Liquid Damage Symptoms

Some mobile-device cases provide a degree of waterproofing. Waterproofing is rated on the Ingress Protection (IP) scale. A case or device will have two numbers, such as IP67. The first (6) is a rating for repelling solids, with a 5 or 6 representing devices that are dust protected and dust proof, respectively. The second value (7) is for liquids, with a 7 being protected from immersion in up to 1 m and 8 being protected from immersion beyond 1 m.

*If dust protection is unrated, the IP value will be IPX7 or IPX8.*

If a mobile device is exposed to **liquid damage**, there may be visible signs of water under the screen. The screen might display graphics artefacts or not show an image. Even if there is no visible sign, power off the device immediately if you suspect liquid damage. Dry as much excess liquid as possible. If you suspect that the internal components have been exposed, the device must be disassembled to fully dry. Once dry, clean the circuit boards and contacts. The battery will usually need to be replaced.

### Physically Damaged Port Symptoms

Improper insertion and removal of connectors can easily **damage the external ports** of a mobile device. If a port is damaged, the connector may be loose or may no longer fit. There may be no data connection at all, or it might be intermittent. The device may fail to charge properly.

Educate users to remove a connector by holding the connector and pulling it straight. A connector should not be jiggled to remove it. USB-C and Lightning connectors are reversible. Make sure users take care to orient other connector types properly before plugging them in.

# Screen and Calibration Issues
----
When you are troubleshooting a mobile display issue, you will often need to take into account the use of the integrated display and/or an external display and how to isolate a problem to a particular component, such as the graphics adapter, display panel, backlight, and digitizer.

If there is no image on the screen, check that the video card is good by using an external monitor. Alternatively, there should be a very dim image on the display if the graphics adapter is functioning, but the backlight has failed. Most screens use LED backlights. Older laptops might use an inverter component to power a fluorescent backlight.

*As well as the display itself, it is common for the plastics around a laptop case to get cracked or broken and for the hinges on the lid to wear out. The plastics are mostly cosmetic (though a bad break might expose the laptop's internal components to greater risks), but if the hinges no longer hold up the screen, they will have to be replaced.*

### Broken Screen Issues

Mobile devices are very easy to drop, and while the glass is designed to be tough, impacts on a hard surface from over 1m in height will usually result in cracking or shattering. If only the glass layer is damaged, the digitizer and display may remain usable, to some extent. A **broken screen** is likely to require warranty or professional services to repair it, however.

*If there are no visible cracks, the screen or digitizer circuitry may have been damaged by liquid.*

### Digitizer Issues

Symptoms such as the touch screen not responding to input indicate a problem with the digitizer. If you can discount shock and liquid damage, try the following tests:

- Verify that the touchscreen and the user’s fingers are clean and dry.
- If a screen protector is fitted, check that it is securely adhered to the surface and that there are no bubbles or lifts.
- Check that there is not a transitory software problem by restarting the device.
- Try using the device in a different location in case some source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) is affecting the operation of the digitizer.
- If the device has just been serviced, check that the right wires are still connected in the right places for the digitizer to function. Remember to ask, "What has changed?"

### Cursor Drift/Touch Calibration Issues

On a laptop, if touchpad sensitivity is too high, typing can cause vibrations that move the cursor. Examples include the pointer drifting across the screen without any input or a "ghost cursor" jumping about when typing. Install up-to-date drivers and configure input options to suit the user. Many laptops now come with a Fn key to disable the touchpad.

If you can rule out simple hardware causes, unresponsive or inaccurate touch input can be an indication of resources being inadequate (too many open apps) or badly written apps that hog memory or other resources. A soft reset will usually fix the problem in the short term. If the problem is persistent, either try to identify whether the problem is linked to running a particular app or try freeing space by removing data or apps. Windows devices and some versions of Android support re-calibration utilities, but if you cannot identify another cause, then you are likely to have to look at warranty repair.


# Connectivity Issues
----
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth **connectivity** issues on a mobile can be approached in much the same way as on a PC. Problems can generally be categorized as either relating to "physical" issues, such as interference, or to "software" configuration problems.

Consider these guidelines when you are troubleshooting issues with communication and connectivity:

- Verify that the adapter is enabled. Check the status of function key toggles on a laptop, or use the notification shade toggles on a mobile device to check that airplane mode has not been enabled or that the specific radio is not disabled.
- If a laptop has been serviced recently and wireless functions have stopped working, check that the antenna connector has not been dislodged or wrongly connected.
- If a wireless peripheral such as a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard that has been working stops, it probably needs a new battery.
- If you experience problems restoring from hibernate or sleep mode, try cycling the power on the device or reconnecting it and checking for updated drivers for the wireless controller and the devices.

If you are experiencing intermittent connectivity issues:

- Try moving the two devices closer together.
- Try moving the devices from a side-to-side or up-and-down position to a different position or changing the way in which the device is held.

*The radio antenna wire for a mobile will be built into the case (normally around the screen). On some devices, certain hand positions can stop the antenna from functioning as well as it should.*

- Consider using a Wi-Fi analyzer to measure the signal strength in different locations to try to identify the source of interference.

A similar utility (Cell Tower Analyzer or GSM Signal Monitor) can be used to analyze cellular radio signals, which use different frequencies than Wi-Fi uses. An app might combine both functions.

# Malware Issues
----
Whenever a device does not function as expected, you should assess whether it could be infected with malware. Consider the following scenarios:

- Malware or rogue apps are likely to try to collect data in the background. They can become unresponsive and might not shut down when closed. Such apps might cause excessive power drain and high resource utilization, potentially leading to overheating problems.
- Another tell-tale sign of a hacked device is reaching the data transmission overlimit unexpectedly. Most devices have an option to monitor data usage and have limit triggers to notify the user if the limit has been reached. This protects from large data bills but should also prompt the user to check the amount of data used by each application in order to monitor their legitimacy.
- Malware may try to use the camera or microphone to record activity. Check that the camera LED is not activated.


# Review
----
1. You are troubleshooting a laptop display. **If the laptop can display an image on an external monitor but not on the built-in one, which component do you know is working, and can you definitively say which is faulty?**

The graphics adapter is working. The problem must exist either in the cabling to the built-in screen or with a screen component, such as an inverter, backlight, or the display panel itself. Further tests will be required to identify which.

2. You received a user complaint about a laptop being extremely hot to the touch. What actions should you take in response to this issue?

Overheating can be a sign that dust and dirt is restricting the necessary airflow within the device, so start by cleaning the ventilation duct with compressed air, and then make sure that the device is getting proper air circulation around the outside of the case, such as by supplying a chiller pad.

3. A user complains that their Bluetooth keyboard, which has worked for the last year, has stopped functioning. What would you suggest is the problem?

The batteries in the keyboard have run down—replace them.

4. A laptop user reports that they are only getting about two hours of use out of the battery compared to about three hours when the laptop was first supplied to them. What do you suggest?

Batteries lose maximum charge over time. It may be possible to recondition the battery or to use power-saving features, but the only real way to restore maximum battery life is to buy a new battery.

5. A laptop user is complaining about typing on their new laptop. They claim that the cursor jumps randomly from place to place. What might be the cause of this?

The user could be touching the touchpad while typing, or vibrations could be affecting the touchpad. Update the driver or reduce the sensitivity/disable touch and tap events.
