What is a region?
	A cluster of data centers

How to choose an AWS Region
	Compliance - W/ data goverance and legal requirements - data never leaves a region w/out your explicit permission
	Proximity to customers: reduced latency
	Available services with a region: New services and new features aren't available in every region
	Pricing: varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
