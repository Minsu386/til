## Knowledge Management System
- The Zettelkasten note taking
- core 4 principles
	- Write all the time. In your own words if possible.
	- Everything is knowledge
	- Notes are irreducible, complete thoughts.   think about still one complete thought. 
	- Knowledge is interconnected.  How does this connect to something already in the  Zettelkasten, and  is there something I already know that connects b ack to this. 

- Step 1 Take Fleeting Notes
	- catch bits of knowledge, thoughts, that you capture throughout the day. 
		- for example reading a text book. Place highlight tabs where you would like to go back and take notes.  Larger Sticky notes to put in larger snips of what you were thinking of while reading that section. 
- Step 2 Make Permanent Notes
	- go through each sticky notes and ask if if is an important enough thing to write a note about.
