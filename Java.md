## First Steps
----
### Java Classes
```java
public class JavaProgram {
  public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.print("hello world"); }
}
```

### Comments
Just like with JavaScript, if a line begins with // the compiler will ignore the remainder of the line
`// this is a comment`

```java
/* This
is
block
comment
*/
```

### Printing Statements

Java works by having **object** perform action
`System.out`  : an object used for sending output to the screen

actions performed by objects are called **methods**
`println`: the method or action that the `System.out` object performs

Syntax:  An object, a dot, the method name, and a pair of parentheses
`System.out.println("This is an argument)`

After every statement, you must place a semicolon at the end of the line 

You can use the shortcut `sout` to type quickly the println statement

## Variables

Form: TYPE NAME;
String FirstName;

statement is declaration.  Declares that the variable named **FirstName** has the type string
