Data Binding is the process of connecting the view element or user interface,
with the data which populates it. 

One-way Data Binding: ReactJS uses one-way data binding. In one-way data 
binding one of the following conditions can be followed:

- Component to View: Any change in component data would get reflected in the view.
- View to Component: Any change in View would get reflected in the componentâ€™s data.
