# Redux
----

A [JavaScript](JavaScript.md) library for managing application state, often used with [React](React.md)


## State
----

Component Level
- state that only matters in the actual component
	- example  - in a header for a menu to open or close (hamburger)  you might have a piece of state called open that is set to true. When it is closed it will be set to false
		- the rest of the application does not care about the state of said button


useState - ideally used for component level state and not global or app level state

State management refers to the way that we manage the data that our application needs to keep track of. 

To change state we dispatch an action which is an object that describes what state change we want to make. 

Then the [Redux](Redux) store will then run the reducer fn to figure out how to update that state based on the action.


Src > index.js is the entry point for React. 

Slices -- A way to organize your state
	- collection of reducers and actions that are related to each other
