How to make this into a habit
- Turn collecting into a habit
- every time something comes up, write it down.  eventually put into Obsidian

When to do things:
- Immediately, if task takes less than 2 minutes. 
- At the time they're scheduled in your calendar
-  immediately if it's a decision ( or create an action for it )
