[HTML5](HTML5.md)  is a markup language. 

- Elements consists of an opening and closing tag ( or a self=closing tag), any possibly various attributes and child content.

- **TAGS** Syntactically, an element consist of a pair of "tags" - an opening and closing tag. A tag consists of a pair of angle brackets surrounding one more characters - the tag name.  
	- tags can have attributes as well

### HTML **Entities** 
- Start off with &;  
- &lt stands for less than symbol <
- &gt stands for the greater than symbol >
- &copy stands for copyright symbol Â©
- &nbps stands for no break space


### **Block and Inline Elements**
[YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf9pfhSgqCY)

- A "**Block**" element will ALWAYS get its own line in the document when it's rendered
- "Inline" means that it doesn't get a line to itself - it will line up in a row against any other inline elements that come after or before it. 
- `<div>`  (separate line), `<span>` (same line), `<align>` (positioning)

### Use Attributes to label Elements or configure their properties 
[YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X19-OyzqAI)

- The **id** attribute can be used to distinguish the role that certain tags play. This can make it easier to find out where you are when you're reading a larger HTML file.
	- Unique
- Images and src
	- `<img src="insert url here" id="insert id label here" />
	- images `<img>` are slightly different from other HTML tags. In that they are **Self-Closing**. 
- Links and href / target
	- "anchor" tags `<a>` or as they're more commonly called, links ( or hyperlinks)
	- `<a href="insert url'> insert label for url</a>"`
	- Opens a new tab when a user clicks on the link add `target="_blank"`
		- `<a href="insert url" target="_blank"> insert label for url</a>`

# Cascading Styling Sheet
[CSS](CSS.md) 

### Combining Selectors ( descendant, child, adjacent, sibling ) 
- Descendant Selector
	- This selector selects all instances of an HTML element that are descendants of a specified ancestor element. It matches any element that is a descendant of another element. 
   ```CSS
   body {
   /* Styles to be applied */
   }
```

- Child selector ( + )
	- Selects only the direct children of a parent element. It matches any element that is a direct child of another element
        ```CSS
	 parent > child {
	   /* Styles to be applied */
	 }   
```

- Adjacent Sibling selector ( + ) 
	- Selects an element that is immediately follows another specific element.
```CSS
element1 + element2 {
  /* Styles to be applied */
}
```

- General Sibling selector ( ~ )
	- The "general sibling" selector selects all elements that follow another (come after) specific element, regardless of their position in the HTML document.
```CSS
element1 ~ element2 {
  /* Styles to be applied */
}
```

## Centering w/ CSS
```CSS
.card {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 150px;
  background-color; cyan;
  align-items: center;
}
```

```html
<li class="card">
  <div>
    <span>hello</span>
    <a href="">some linke</a>
    <div>example</div>
  </div>
</li>
```



# JavaScript
----

[JavaScript](JavaScript.md)

Programing language that controls the behavior of the document of the browser.

- Programming is often concern with transforming input into output
- Analysis and decision making
- Repetition
- Social Activity
- Creative Process (create application and debug)

### Pseudocode
----
Informal set of instructions that describes how a program operates

Solve problem informally mapping out a program to visualize the solution to a problem and convey that to rules for a computer, which takes instructions literally and much more detailed.
- Make a pie
	- Turn on oven
	- if oven temp is less than 375 degrees, wait 1 minute and then repeat step 2
	- Else, mix ingredients into bowl
	- Put pie crust into dish
	- Put mixture into pie crust
	- Put pie into oven
	- check if pie is golden brown - if not - wait 1 minute and then repeat step 7
	- else, remote from oven


### Development LifeCycle
----

Process in which 
- Understand the problem
- Design the solution in pseudocode
- Implement the solution in real code
- Test the solution against various different inputs
- if a problem occurs, solve it using the same process ( back to step 1)




### Data Types
----
There are 7 types of data in JS. 
- String - values wrap in " "   `"textual data"`
	- String values are **immutable**, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
- Numbers
- Boolean 
- Null - Which represents a lack of value
- Undefined - Which is similar to null. There are some subtle differences between the two
	- see below 
- Objects - Composite collection of data ) like a person, animal or type
- Symbol

- Numbers
// The number 5
console.log(5)

// Addition
console.log(4 + 4)

// Subtraction
console.log(14 - 3) 
  
// Multiplication
console.log(9 * 3)

// Exponents
console.log(9*3) 
  
// Division
console.log(7 / 3)
  
// Modular (MOD)
console.log(4 % 3) **THIS WILL SHOW THE REMAINDER WHICH IS 1**


- Null and Undefined (both represent the absence of a value)
	Can be created in multiple ways, but you have to maintain 1 method throughout for consistency
		- console.log(null)  - represents "has no value"
		- console.log(undefined) - represents "has not been given a value"
		- console.log( 1 + undefined)  NaN - This means Not a Number




## HTML Elements in JS
---

When JS exe, it has access to a variable containing an object called **document**. This obj provides the means for your JS to communicate with the document that your browser displays based on your HTML and CSS. It's the thing that ties everything together!




## Variables
----
- Variables names can not contain spaces
- Must begin with a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign
- can only contain numbers, underscores, letters, or dollar signs
- are case-sensitive

- **Reserved Keywords** may not be used as variables names, because they have other meaning within JavaScript


## Expressions
----
Literals are the building blocks of expressions. An **expression** in JavaScript is a term for any operation that gives us a value that we can do work with ( for example, we can assign the value to a variable, or log it to the console). An expression is usually some combination of literals, variables and operators.

- Literal Expression - is the same as simply writing a literal, like a string or a number
- Math Expression - is the combination some literals ( like strings or numbers ) with a math operator, like `+` or `-`
	- 2*2 // gives us the value 4
	- "Hello " + "World" // gives us the value Hello World
- Variable expression is the term for when we use a variable (NOT for when we assign it).
```JavaScript
let favoriteFood = 'Yakisoba' // this is a variable declaration - this is a 'statement', NOT an 'expression'

favoriteFood // THIS is the variable expression - it "gives" us the value inside the variable
```

finally `let favoriteFood = yakisoba`  this is an example of a **statement**

A **statement** in JavaScript performs some kind of action.


## Boolean
---
If this is true, do this. else, do this other thing. This is called **Flow Control**. That is we're controlling the flow of the program

```JavaScript
let isSunnyOut = true

if (isSunnyOut) {
  console.log("lets go to the park")
} else {
  console.log("let's go see a movie")
}
```

- Start w/ the keyword `if`, followed by a pair of parentheses
- inside the parentheses, write an expression that evaluates to either true or false
- Follow the parentheses with a pair of curly braces
- inside that first pair of braces, you'll write some code to execute if the expression in the parentheses evaluates to true
- At the end of the first pair of curly braces, we follow it w/ the else keyword, and another pair of curly braces
- In the 2nd pair of braces, we write some code to execute if the expression in the parentheses was false

#### Truthy vs Falsy values
----
- Falsy Values
	- null
	- undefined
	- 0
	- NaN
	- false
	- "" (empty string)
- Truthy Values
	- Any nonzero number (including negative numbers)
	- Any non-empty string
	- True
```JavaScript
let emptyString = ""

if (emptyString) {
  console.log("You won't see me")
}

let zero = 0

if (zero) {
  console.log("Me neither")
}
```

above - both eval to false. no code will be logged


### Else If
----
```JavaScript
let temp = 70
let jacket

if ( temp > 70 ) {
  jacket = 'no jacket'
} else if ( temp > 50 ) {
  // temp <= 70
  jacket = 'light jacket'
} else {
  jacket = 'heavy jacket'
}
```

When you use else if, you are chaining a series of **Mutually Exclusive** conditions - only the first statement will execute!


### Switch Statements 
---
A **switch** statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first match `case` value until a  `break` is encountered. 

```JavaScript
switch (lowercaseLetter) {
  case 'a':
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case 'b':
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
```


- Case values are tested with strict equality ( === )
