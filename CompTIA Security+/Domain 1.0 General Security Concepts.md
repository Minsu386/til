# 1.1 Explain Fundamental Security Concepts
----
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)
    - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized users can access data
    - **Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered
    - **Availability**: Ensuring data is accessible when needed
- **Least Privilege**: Users and systems should only have the minimum access necessary.
- **Defense in Depth**: Using multiple security layers to protect assets.
- **Zero Trust**: Trust no one by default; verify all users and devices.
- **Security Through Obscurity**: Hiding security measures (not a strong security approach alone)

# 1.2 Compare security roles and responsibilities
----
- **SOC Analyst**: Monitor security alerts and incidents
- **Security Engineer**: Designs and implements security solutions.
- **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer**):  Leads security strategy.
- **Incident Responder**: Investigates and mitigates security incidents.
- **Penetration Tester**: Simulates cyber-attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Forensic Analyst**: Collects and analyzes evidence after an incident

# 1.3 Explain the importance of security controls
----
**Administrative Control**: Policies, training, risk assessments.
**Technical Controls**: Firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems (IDS).
**Physical Controls**: Locks, security guards, cameras

# 1.4 Identify attack types and threats
----
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, vishing, smishing, tailgating
    - Phishing: Form of fraud where attackers impersonate reputable entities or individuals through emails or other communication methods to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links and attachments
    - Vishing: Short for "voice phishing" type of social engineering attack where criminals use phone calls or voice messages to trick victims into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that can lead to financial loss or identify theft
    - Smishing: Attack that uses SMS text messages to deceive individuals into sharing personal information or downloading malicious software
    - Tailgating: Physical security breach where an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind an authorized individual who has access privileges
- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware
- **Denial-of-Services (DOS) & Distributed DOS (DDoS)**: Overwhelming a system to disrupt services
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepting communication between two parties.
- **SQL Injection**: Injecting malicious SQL queries into databases
- **Zero-day Attack**: Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities

# 1.5 Explain Security Assessments and testing
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifies weaknesses (non-intrusive)
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulates real -world attacks (intrusive)
- **Red Team vs Blue Team**: 
    - Read Team: Offensive Security testers
    - Blue Team: Defensive Security testers

# 1.6 Summarize security frameworks and guidelines
- **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**: Guidelines for cybersecurity best practices
- **ISO 27001**: International standard for information Security Management Systems (ISMS).
- **CIS Controls**: Best practices to defend against cyber threats
- **SOC 2**: Security compliance for service providers

# 1.7 Explain security awareness and training
- **Phishing Simulations**: Helps employees recognize fake emails
- **Security Policies**: Guidelines on passwords, data handling, and incident reporting
- **Security Awareness Training**: Educating users on cybersecurity risk
