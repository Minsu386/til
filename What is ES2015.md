ES2015 was released in 2015. It is also commonly called ES6. It was a pivotal update to JavaScript.

ES stands for ECMAScript, which is the language standard of JavaScript. [ECMA InternationalLinks to an external site.](https://www.ecma-international.org/) is an organization that develops international standards for information technology and they control the standards for JavaScript.

Formerly, ES2015 was called ES6 until the committee that controls ECMAScript editions decided to release annual updates. New versions of ECMAScript are now associated with the year the version is released. With this decision in mind, the ECMAScript committee changed ES6 to ES2015.

Before ES2015, the new edition of JavaScript followed the naming convention ES[version number]. Now each new edition follows the convention ES[release year]. Here is a list of ECMAScript versions:

- ES1 (June 1997)
- ES2 (June 1998)
- ES3 (Dec 1999)
- ES4 (Abandoned)
- ES5 (Dec 2009)
- **ES6 (June 2015) ES2015**
- ES2016 (June 2016, the 7th edition of ECMAScript)
- ES2017 (June 2017, the 8th edition of ECMAScript)
- ES2018 (June 2018, the 9th edition of ECMAScript
- ES2019 (June 2019, the 10th edition of ECMAScript)
- ES2020 (June 2020, the 11th edition of ECMAScript)
- ES2021 (June 2021, the 12th edition of ECMAScript)
- ES2022 (June 2022, the 13th edition of ECMAScript)
