Type of AI tech that can produce various type of content

[[AI]] is the theory and dev of computer system able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.

[[Machine Learning ]]- sub field of AI
	program or system that trains a model from input system
	- Gives the computer the ability to learn w/out explicit programming.

Unsupervised ML models
	Implies the data is not labeled
	Unsupervised problems are all about looking at the raw data, and seeing if it naturally falls into groups.

supervised ML model
	implies the data is already labeled.
		in supervised learning we are learning from past examples to predict future values


## Deep learning
----
Deep learning Model types
- Discriminative
	- Used to classify or predict
	- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
	- Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels
- Generative
	- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on
	- Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is
	- predict next word in a sequence 


## What is Generative AI?
----
- GenAI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that creates new content based on what is has learned from existing content.
- The process of learning from existing content is called  training and results in the creation of a statistical model
- When given a prompt, GenAI uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be--and this generates new content
- Pattern matching system

### How it works

Pretraining :
- Large amounts of Data
- Billions of parameters
- Unsupervised learning

Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect.
Causes
- Model is not trained on enough data
- the model is trained on noisy or dirty data
- not given enough context or constraints
