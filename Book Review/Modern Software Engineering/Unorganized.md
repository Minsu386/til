-- Software engineering as a concept must provide us with an advantage, not merely an opportunity to adopt new tools

**Software Engineering** - is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software.

Root Idea
1. Science and its practical application "engineering" are vital tools in making effective progress in technical disciplines.
2. Out discipline is fundamentally one of learning and discovery, so we need to become experts at learning to succeed, and science and engineering are how we learn most effectively. 
3. The systems that we build are often complex and are increasingly so. Meaning, to cope with their development, we need to become experts at managing that complexity.
