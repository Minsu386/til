As a CompTIA A+ technician, you often assist users with basic network connectivity issues. At this support level, you will be focusing on client issues. As you have learned, networks are complex and involve many different hardware devices, protocols, and applications, meaning that there are lots of things that can go wrong! In this topic, you will learn how to identify and diagnose the causes of some common wired and wireless network issues.

# Troubleshoot Wired Connectivity
----
A client wired connectivity issue means that either the network adapter does not establish a network link at all (no connectivity) or the connection is unstable or intermittent. Assuming that you can establish that the problem affects a single host only, you need to isolate the precise location of the physical issue. 

### Troubleshoot Cable and Network Adapter Issues

A typical Ethernet link for an office workstation includes the following components:

- NIC port on the host.
- RJ45 terminated patch cord between the host and a wall port.
- Structured cable between the wall port and a patch panel, terminated to insulation displacement connector (IDC) blocks (the permanent link).
- RJ45 terminated patch cord between the patch panel port and a switch port.
- Network transceiver in the switch port.

*The link LEDs on network adapter and switch ports will indicate whether the link is active and possibly at what speed the link is working. The LEDs typically flicker to show network activity.*

1. The first step in resolving a no or intermittent connectivity issue is to check that the patch cords are properly terminated and connected to the network ports. If you suspect a fault, substitute the patch cord with a known good cable. You can verify patch cords using a cable tester.
2. If you cannot isolate the problem to the patch cords, test the transceivers. You can use a loopback tool to test for a bad port.
3. If you don't have a loopback tool available, another approach is to substitute known working hosts (connect a different computer to the link or swap ports at the switch). This method may have adverse impacts on the rest of the network, however, and issues such as port security may make it unreliable.
4. If you can discount faulty patch cords and bad network ports/NICs, use a cable tester to verify the structured cabling. The solution may involve installing a new permanent link, but there could also be a termination or external interference problem. An advanced type of cable tester called a "certifier" can report detailed information about cable performance and interference.
5. If there is no issue in the structured cabling, verify the Ethernet speed/duplex configuration on the switch interface and NIC. This should usually be set to autonegotiate. You might also try updating the NIC’s device driver software.

### Troubleshoot Port Flapping Issues

Intermittent connectivity might manifest as **port flapping**, which means that the NIC or switch interface transitions continually between up and down states. This is often caused by bad cabling or external interference or a faulty NIC at the host end. You can use the switch configuration interface to report how long a port remains in the up state.

# Troubleshoot Network Speed Issues
----
The transfer speed of a cabled link could be reduced by mismatched duplex settings on the network adapter and switch port. With Gigabit Ethernet, both should be set to autonegotiate. Check the configuration of the network adapter driver on the client OS and the setting for the switch port via the switch's management software.

If there is no configuration issue, **slow network speeds** can be caused by a variety of other problems and difficult to diagnose. Apply a structured process to investigate possible causes:

1. If a user reports slow speed, establish exactly what network activity they are performing (web browsing, file transfer, authentication, and so on). Establish that there is a link speed problem by checking the nominal link speed and using a utility to measure transfer rate independent of specific apps or network services.
2. If you can isolate the speed issue to a single cable segment, the cabling could be affected by interference. **External interference** is typically caused by nearby power lines, fluorescent lighting, motors, and generators. Poorly installed cabling and connector termination can also cause a type of interference called "crosstalk." Check the ends of cables for excessive untwisting of the wire pairs or improper termination. If you have access to a network tap, the analyzer software is likely to report high numbers of damaged frames. You can also view error rates from the switch interface configuration utility.
3. If the cabling is not the issue, there could be a problem with the network adapter driver. Install an update if available. If the latest driver is installed, check whether the issue affects other hosts using the same NIC and driver version.
4. Consider the possibility that the computer could be infected with malware or have faulty software installed. Consider removing the host from the network for scanning. If you can install a different host to the same network port and that solves the issue, identify what is different about the original host.
5. Establish the scope of the problem: are network speeds an issue for a single user, for all users connected to the same switch, or for all users connecting to the Internet, for instance? There may be congestion at a switch or router or some other network-wide problem. This might be caused by a fault or by user behavior, such as transferring a very large amount of data over the network.

# Troubleshoot Wireless Issues
----
When troubleshooting wireless networks, as with cabled links, you need to consider problems with the physical media, such as interference, and configuration issues.

The radio frequency (RF) signal from radio-based devices weakens considerably as the distance between the devices increases. If you experience **intermittent wireless connectivity**, slow transfer speeds, or inability to establish a connection, as a first step, try moving the devices closer together. If you still cannot obtain a connection, check that the security and authentication parameters are correctly configured on both devices.

### Troubleshooting Wireless Configuration Issues

If a user is looking for a network name that is not shown in the list of available wireless networks (SSID not found), the user could be out of range or the SSID name broadcast might be suppressed. In the latter scenario, the connection to the network name must be configured manually on the client.

Another factor to consider is standards mismatch. If an access point is not operating in compatibility mode, it will not be able to communicate with devices that only support older standards. Also, when an older device joins the network, the performance of the whole network can be affected. To support 802.11b clients, an 802.11b/g/n access point must transmit legacy frame preamble and collision avoidance frames, adding overhead. If possible, upgrade 802.11b devices rather than letting them join the WLAN. Both 802.11g and 802.11n/ac/ax are more compatible in terms of negotiating collision avoidance.

Also consider that not all clients supporting 802.11n have dual-band radios. If a client cannot connect to a network operating on the 5 GHz band, check whether its radio is 2.4 GHz-capable only.

### Received Signal Strength Indicator

A wireless adapter will reduce the connection speed if the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is not at a minimum required level. The RSSI is an index level calculated from the signal strength level. For example, an 802.11n adapter might be capable of a 144 Mbps data rate with an optimum signal, but if the signal is weak, it might reduce to a 54 Mbps or 11 Mbps rate to make the connection more reliable. If the RSSI is too low, the adapter will drop the connection entirely and try to use a different network. If there are two weak networks, the adapter might "flap" between them. Try moving to a location with better reception.

### Troubleshooting Wireless Signal Issues

If a device is within the supported range but the signal is weak or you can only get an **intermittent connection**, there is likely to be interference from another radio source broadcasting at the same frequency. If this is the case, try adjusting the channel that the devices use. Another possibility is interference from a powerful electromagnetic source, such as a motor, or a microwave oven. Finally, there might be something blocking the signal. Radio waves do not pass easily through metal or dense objects. Construction materials, such as wire mesh, foil-backed plasterboard, concrete, and mirrors, can block or degrade signals. Try angling or repositioning the device or antenna to try to get better reception.

Wi-Fi analyzer software is designed to identify the signal strength of nearby networks on each channel. It shows the signal strength, measured in dBm, and expressed as a negative value, where values close to zero represent a stronger signal. The analyzer will show how many networks are utilizing each channel. Setting the network to use a less congested channel can improve performance.



# Troubleshoot VoIP Issues
----
While slow network speeds are a problem for all types of network traffic, there are other performance characteristics that affect real-time network protocols and devices. "Real time" refers to services such as voice and video. One example is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) protocols. These use data networks to implement voice calling. The symptoms of poor VoIP service quality are dropouts, echo, or other glitches in the call.

With "ordinary" data, it might be beneficial to transfer a file as quickly as possible, but the sequence in which the packets are delivered and variable intervals between packets arriving do not materially affect the application. This type of data transfer is described as "bursty." Network protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, or email, are sensitive to packet loss but tolerant of delays in delivery. The reverse is applicable to real-time applications. These can compensate for some amount of packet loss but are very sensitive to delays in data delivery or packets arriving out of sequence.

Problems with the timing and sequence of packet delivery are defined as latency and jitter:

- **Latency** is the time it takes for a signal to reach the recipient, measured in milliseconds (ms). Latency increases with distance and can be made worse by processing delays at intermediate systems, such as routers. VoIP can support a maximum one-way latency of about 150 ms. Round trip time (RTT) or two-way latency is the time taken for a host to receive a response to a probe.
- **Jitter** is the amount of variation in delay over time and is measured by sampling the elapsed time between packets arriving. VoIP can use buffering to tolerate jitter of up to around 30 ms without severe impact on call quality. Jitter is typically caused by network congestion affecting packet processing on routers and switches.

VoIP call quality can only really be established by using a quality of service (QoS) mechanism across the network. QoS means that switches, access points, and routers are all configured to identify VoIP data and prioritize it over bursty data. Enterprise networks can deploy sophisticated QoS and traffic engineering protocols on managed switches and routers. However, it is difficult to guarantee QoS over a public network, such as the Internet.

On a SOHO network, you may be able to configure a QoS or bandwidth control feature on the router/modem to prioritize the port used by a VoIP application over any other type of protocol. This will help to mitigate issues if, for example, one computer is trying to download a Windows 10 feature update at the same time as another set of computers are trying to host a video conference.

You should also be able to use the management interface to report connection latency and possibly jitter too. If not, you can use a speed test site to measure latency and bandwidth. If latency is persistently higher than an agreed service level, contact your ISP to resolve the issue.

# Troubleshoot Limited Connectivity
----
In Windows, a **limited connectivity** message specifically means that the host can establish a physical connection to the network but has not received a lease for an IP configuration from a DHCP server. The host will be configured with an address in the automatic IP addressing (APIPA) 169.254.x.y range. A Linux host might also use APIPA, set the IP address to unknown (0.0.0.0), or just leave IP unconfigured.

- **Establish the scope of the issue**—If the issue affects multiple users, the problem is likely to be the DHCP server itself. Remember that DHCP leases take time to expire, so a problem with the DHCP server might take a few hours to manifest as different clients try to renew their leases over time. The DHCP server could be offline, it could have run out of available leases, or forwarding between the server and clients could be improperly configured.
- **Check the configuration of patch cords**—Verify that the wall port is connected to an appropriate port on a switch via the patch panel. If the computer is not connected to an appropriate switch port, it is unlikely to connect to the expected services, such as its default gateway, DHCP, and DNS.
- **Check the VLAN configuration**—If the switch port is not configured with the correct VLAN ID, it can have the same effect as connecting the host to the wrong switch port.

Windows may also report that a network adapter has no Internet access. This means that the adapter has obtained an IP configuration (or is configured statically) but cannot reach msftncsi.com to download a test file. This error indicates that there is an issue with either Internet access at the gateway router or name resolution. On a SOHO network, access the router management interface and verify the Internet connection via a status update page. If the link is down, contact your ISP. The router may also have tools to test connectivity. Verify that it can connect to the servers configured for DNS.


# Review
----
1. You are updating a support knowledge base article to help technicians identify port flapping. How can port flapping be identified?

Use the switch configuration interface to observe how long the port remains in an up state. Port flapping means that the port transitions rapidly between up and down states.

2. A user reports that the Internet is slow. What first step should you take to identify the problem?

Verify the link speed independently of user apps, such as web browsing, to determine if there is a cable or port problem.

3. You are trying to add a computer to a wireless network but cannot detect the network name. What possible causes should you consider?

The network name is configured as nonbroadcast and must be entered manually, the wireless standard supported by the adapter is not supported by the access point, the station is not in range, or there is some sort of interference.

4. What readings would you expect to gather with a Wi-Fi analyzer? 

The signal strength of different Wi-Fi networks and their channels that are operating within range of the analyzer.

5. A probe reports that the Internet connection has RTT latency of 200 ms. What is the likely impact on VoIP call quality?

Most vendors recommend that one-way latency should not exceed 150 ms. Round trip time (RTT) measures two-way latency, so 200 ms is within the recommended 300 ms tolerance. Call quality should not be severely impacted, but if latency is persistently that high, it might be worth investigating the cause.

6. A user reports that a “Limited connectivity” desktop notification is displayed on their computer, and they cannot connect to the Internet. Will you need to replace the NIC in the computer?

No. Limited connectivity reported by the OS means that the link has been established, but the host has not been able to contact a DHCP server to obtain a lease for a valid configuration.
