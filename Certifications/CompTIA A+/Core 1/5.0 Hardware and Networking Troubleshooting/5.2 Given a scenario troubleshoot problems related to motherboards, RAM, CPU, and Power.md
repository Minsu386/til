# Troubleshoot Power Issue
----

PC components need a constant, stable supply of power to run. If the computer will not start, it is likely to be due to a power problem. If the PC suddenly turns off or restarts, power is a common cause.

When a computer is switched on, the power supply unit (PSU) converts the AC input voltage (VAC) to DC voltages (VDC). DC voltage is used to power the motherboard components and peripheral devices. The PSU supplies 12 V power immediately, and the fans and hard disks should spin up. The PSU then tests its 5 V and 3.3 V supplies. When it is sure that it is providing a stable supply, it sends a power good signal to the processor.

To diagnose **no power** symptoms, check if the LEDs on the front panel of the system case are lit up and whether you can hear the fans. A power issue might arise due to a fault in the PSU, incoming electricity supply, power cables/connectors, or fuses. To isolate the cause of no power, try the following tests:

1. Check that other equipment in the area is working—There may be a fault in the power circuit or a wider complete failure of power (a blackout).
2. Try plugging another piece of known-good basic electrical equipment, such as a lamp, into the wall socket. If it does not work, the wall socket is faulty. Get an electrician to investigate the fault.
3. Check that the PSU cabling is connected to the PC and the wall socket correctly and that all switches are in the "on" position.
4. Try another power cable—There may be a problem with the plug or fuse. Check that all the wires are connected to the correct terminals in the plug. Check the fuse resistance with a multimeter or swap with a known good fuse.
5. Try disconnecting extra devices, such as a plug-in graphics card. If this solves the problem, either the PSU is underpowered and you need to fit one with a higher wattage rating, or one of the devices is faulty.
6. If you can ensure a safe working environment, test the PSU using a multimeter or power supply tester.

*You must take appropriate safety measures before testing a live power supply. PC power supplies are NOT user serviceable. Never remove the cover of a power supply.*

If you still cannot identify the fault, then the problem is likely to be a faulty motherboard or power supply. If you suspect that a power supply is faulty, do not leave it turned on for longer than necessary and do not leave it unattended. Keep an eye out for external signs of a problem (for example, smoke or fire). Turn off immediately if there are any unusual sights, smells, or noises.

# Troubleshoot POST Issues
----
Once the CPU has been given the power good signal, the system firmware performs a **power-on self-test (POST)**. The POST is a diagnostic program implemented in the system firmware that checks the hardware to ensure the components required to boot the PC are present and functioning correctly.

*On modern computers the POST happens very quickly to improve boot times, so you are unlikely to see any POST messages. Also, the PC is likely to be configured to show a logo screen and will only display messages under error conditions.*

If power is present—you can hear the fans spinning, for instance—but the computer does not start, there is a **black screen**, and there are no beeps from the internal speaker, it is likely either that the display is faulty or that the POST procedure is not executing. Assuming you can rule out an issue with the display, to troubleshoot POST, try the following tests and solutions:

1. **Ask what has changed**—If the system firmware has been updated and the PC has not booted since, the system firmware update may have failed. Use the reset procedure.
2. **Check cabling and connections, especially if maintenance work has just been performed on the PC**—An incorrectly oriented storage adapter cable or a badly seated adapter card can stop the POST from running. Correct any errors, reset adapter cards, and then reboot the PC.
3. **Check for faulty interfaces and devices**—It is possible that a faulty adapter card or device is halting the POST. Try removing one device at a time to see if this solves the problem (or remove all non-essential devices, then add them back one by one).
4. **Check the PSU**—Even though the fans are receiving power, there may be a fault that is preventing the power good signal from being sent to the CPU, preventing POST.
5. **Check for a faulty CPU or system firmware**—If possible, replace the CPU chip with a known good one or update the system firmware.

*Some motherboards have jumpers to configure modes (such as firmware recovery) or processor settings. If the jumpers are set incorrectly, it could cause the computer not to boot. If a computer will not work after being serviced, check that the jumpers have not been changed.*

If POST runs but detects a problem, it generates an error message. As the fault may prevent the computer from displaying anything on the screen, the error is often indicated by a **beep code**. Use resources such as the manufacturer's website to determine the meaning of the beep code.

The codes for the original IBM PC are listed in this table.

*Some PCs will not boot if a key is stuck. Check that nothing is resting on the keyboard. If the board is clogged with dust or sticky liquid, clean it using approved products, such as swabs and compressed air blowers.*


# Troubleshoot OS Errors and Crash Screens

If a boot device is located, the code from the boot sector on the selected device is loaded into memory and takes over from the system firmware. The boot sector code loads the rest of the operating system files into system memory. Error messages received after this point can usually be attributed to software or device driver problems rather than physical issues with hardware devices.

If there is a serious fault, a Windows system will display a **blue screen of death (BSOD)**. This typically indicates that there is a system memory fault, a hardware device/driver fault, or corruption of operating system files. Use a camera to scan the quick response (QR) error code and open the URL with further information. The error should also be written to the System log with BugCheck as the source. From the event description, use the first hex value, such as 0x0a, to find information about the event online. The system will generate a memory dump that you can forward for analysis if you have a support contract.

*A blue screen is a Windows **proprietary** **crash screen**. A macOS system that suffers catastrophic process failure shows a spinning **pinwheel** (of death), also called a spinning wait cursor. Linux displays a kernel panic or “Something has gone wrong” message.*


# Troubleshoot Performance Issues
----
Performance issues are one of the hardest types of problem to diagnose and troubleshoot because the symptoms of poor performance have a wide variety of causes. Use a structured approach to try to compartmentalize the source of the performance issue:

1. **Check for overheating**—If the temperature is too high, the CPU and other components are likely to reduce the performance level to avoid overheating. This is referred to as throttling. Check temperature sensors and fan speeds. If these are high, check whether the computer needs cleaning or if cooling systems need to be replaced or upgraded.
2. **Check for misconfigurations**—If the symptom of sluggish performance is found on a new build or after an upgrade or maintenance, verify the compatibility of new components with the motherboard. For example, a memory upgrade might result in the computer no longer using dual-channel mode, reducing performance. Remember to ask the question “What has changed?” when a problem is reported.
3. **Verify the problem**—A PC has compute, storage, and networking functions. Any three of these may be the source of sluggish performance. If possible, use diagnostic tests to compare performance of the CPU, system memory, fixed disk, and network adapter to known performance baselines. Quantifying what “sluggish” really means and isolating the issue to a particular subsystem will help to identify the probable cause. If the system performance is not sufficient, one or more subsystems can be upgraded.

*A bottleneck is an underpowered component that slows down the whole system. For example, a PC might have a fast CPU, dedicated graphics, and lots of system memory, but if the fixed disk is an HDD, then performance will be very slow.*

**Rule out operating system/app/configuration/networking issues**—Users might describe a computer’s performance as sluggish when in fact there is a configuration problem. For example, a computer might seem to be unresponsive and lead the user to say, “My computer is slow,” but the issue is caused by a faulty network login script, and the fault does not actually lie in the computer. Try to rule out issues with the operating system and apps before assuming that there is a hardware issue. You can use a built-in or third-party diagnostic suite to verify the performance of individual components. If the diagnostic tool does not indicate a problem, suspect a software/configuration issue.

# Troubleshoot Component Issues
----

Symptoms such as the system locking up, **intermittent shutdowns**, continuous rebooting, OS blue screen/Kernel panic errors, and **application crashes** are difficult to diagnose with a specific cause, especially if you are not able to witness the events directly. The most likely causes are software, disk/file corruption problems, or malware.

If you can discount these, try to establish whether the problem is truly intermittent or whether there is a pattern to the errors. If they occur when the PC has been running for some time, it could be a thermal problem.

Next, check that the power supply is providing good, stable voltages to the system. If you can discount the power supply, you must start to suspect a problem with memory, CPU, or motherboard. The vendor may supply a diagnostic test program that can identify hardware-level errors. These programs are often run from the firmware setup utility rather than from the OS.

If no diagnostic utilities are available, you might be able to identify motherboard, RAM, or CPU hardware issues by observing physical symptoms.

### Overheating

Excessive heat can easily damage the sensitive circuitry of a computer. If a system feels hot to the touch, you should check for **overheating** issues. Unusual odors, such as a **burning smell** or smoke, will almost always indicate something (probably the power supply) is overheating. The system should be shut down immediately and the problem investigated. A burning smell may also arise because the case and/or fan vents are clogged with dust.

*CPUs and other system components heat up while running. Take care not to burn yourself when handling internal components.*

Other techniques for diagnosing and correcting overheating issues include the following:

- Most systems come with internal temperature sensors that you can check via driver or management software. Use the vendor documentation to confirm that the system is operating within acceptable limits.
- Ensure that the CPU fan is working. Proper cooling is vital to the lifespan and performance of the processor. If the processor is running too hot, it can decrease performance. A processor that is overheating can cause crashes or reboot the machine. Is the fan's power cable properly connected? Is the fan jammed, clogged, or too small? If a processor upgrade is installed, the fan from the original CPU may not be suitable for the new device.
- Make sure the heat sink is properly fitted. It should be snug against the processor. It might be necessary to clean away old thermal paste and replace it to help the processor to run at a lower temperature.
- Always use blanking plates to cover up holes in the back or front of the PC. Holes can disrupt the airflow and decrease the effectiveness of the cooling systems.
- Verify whether the room in which the PC is installed is unusually warm or dusty or whether the PC is positioned near a radiator or in direct sunlight.

Thermal problems may also affect system operation by causing loose connectors to drift apart, components to move in their sockets, or circuit board defects such as hairline cracks to widen and break connections. Some of these faults can be detected by visual inspection.

### Physical Damage

Actual physical damage to a computer system is usually caused to peripherals, ports, and cables. Damage to other components is only likely if the unit has been in transit somewhere. Inspect a unit closely for damage to the case; even a small crack or dent may indicate a fall or knock that could have caused worse damage to the internal components than is obvious from outside.

If a peripheral device does not work, examine the port and the end of the cable closely for bent, broken, or dirty pins and connectors. Examine the length of the cable for damage.

Few problems are actually caused by the motherboard itself, but there are a few things to be aware of.

- The motherboard's soldered chips and components could be damaged by electrostatic discharge (ESD), electrical spikes, or overheating.
- The pins on integrated connectors can also be damaged by careless insertion of plugs and adapter cards.
- In some cases, errors may be caused by dirt (clean the contacts on connectors) or chip creep, where an adapter works loose from its socket over time, perhaps because of temperature changes.
- If a system has had liquid spilled on it or if fans or the keyboard are clogged by dust or dirt, there may be visible signs of this.
- If a component has "blown," it can leave scorch marks. You could also look for **capacitor swelling**. The capacitors are barrel-like components that regulate the flow of electricity to the system chips. If they are swollen or bulging or emitting any kind of residue, they could have been damaged or could have failed due to a manufacturing defect.

If there is physical damage to the motherboard, you will almost certainly need diagnostic software to run tests that confirm whether there is a problem. Testing by substituting "known good" components would be too time consuming and expensive. It is worth investigating any environmental problems or maintenance procedures that could be the "root cause" of the error.

# Troubleshoot Inaccurate System Date/Time
----

It is important for computers to keep time accurately. If the date and time are not correctly synchronized with other computers on the network or on the Internet, security systems such as authentication will not work and utilities such as backup programs and schedulers will be unreliable.

The real time clock (RTC) is a part of the chipset that keeps track of the calendar date and time. This component runs on battery power when the computer is turned off. The RTC battery is a coin cell lithium battery.

![](Meta/Pasted%20image%2020230926084458.png)

If the date or time displayed in the system firmware setup program is inaccurate, it can be a sign that the RTC battery is failing. You should replace it with the same size and type. Typically, the coin cell type is CR2032, but check the motherboard documentation.

*The RTC battery is also often called the CMOS battery. On older computers, system firmware custom settings were saved to CMOS RAM. CMOS stands for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, which describes the manufacturing process used to make the RAM chip. CMOS requires battery backup to save data. On current motherboards, configuration data is stored in a non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) chip (flash memory), rather than in CMOS RAM. Flash memory does not require battery backup.*
