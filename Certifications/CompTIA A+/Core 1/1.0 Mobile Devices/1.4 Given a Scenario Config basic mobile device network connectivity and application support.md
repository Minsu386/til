# 11.5 Wireless Networking | Slide 223

## Wireless Networking Facts
----

In addition to copper wires and fiber optic cables, networks can also transmit data using radio waves. This technology is called wireless networking (Wi-Fi).

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Wireless communication
- Wireless standards
- Long-range wireless

**Wireless Communication**

Wireless networks send data through the air using radio waves. These radio waves are referred to as an unbounded medium because they are not encased in a sheath like a fiber optic cable or unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables. This means that the wireless signal can reach areas that a wired network cannot.

Wireless networks use specific radio frequency ranges that are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The two most common frequencies used by wireless networks are the 2.4 GHZ and 5 GHz ranges.

- 2.4 GHz wireless signals are wider, but shorter. This means they can travel further, but transmit data at a slower rate.
- 5 GHz wireless signals are thinner, but taller. This means they do not travel as far, but can transmit data at a faster rate.

These wireless frequency ranges are considered unlicensed. This means that you do not need special permission to use them. It also means that other devices can also use these frequencies. If two devices using the same frequency are in the same area, the wireless signals will collide and the signals will be dropped.

To remedy this situation, you can adjust the channel on the wireless network. Changing the wireless channel will slightly adjust the frequency to avoid conflicts. Each channel is approximately 20 MHz wide. This means that many of the channels overlap slightly.

The 2.4 GHz range has three non-overlapping channels and the 5 GHz range has 24 non-overlapping channels.

**Wireless Standard**

Wireless networks are all defined by the IEEE 802.11 standards. These standards specify ways to increase bandwidth and reduce interference when transferring data using radio waves. The standards are all labeled with the 802.11 designation and letters designate the updated standard.

The following table describes the 802.11 standards.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Specification|Standard|   |   |   |   |   |
| |802.11a|802.11b|802.11g|802.11n|802.11ac  <br>(Wi-Fi 5)|802.11ax  <br>(Wi-Fi 6)|
|Frequency|5 GHz|2.4 GHz|2.4 GHz|2.4 GHz or  <br>5 GHz|5 GHz|2.4 GHz or 5 GHz|
|Maximum speed|54 Mbps|11 Mbps|54 Mbps|600 Mbps|3.46 Gbps|14 Gbps|
|Maximum distance|100 ft.|150 ft.|150 ft.|300 ft.|300 ft.|300 ft.|
|Channels  <br>(non-overlapped)|23 (12)|11 (3)|11 (3)|2.4 GHz:  <br>11 (3 or 1)  <br>5 GHz:  <br>23 (12 or 6)|Depends on configuration|Depends on configuration|
|Backwards compatibility|N/A|None|802.11b|802.11a/b/g, depending on implementation|802.11b/g/n|802.11b/g/n/ac|

The ability of newer devices to communicate with older devices depends on the capabilities of the transmit radios in the access point. For example, some 802.11n devices can transmit at either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz. However, a single radio cannot transmit at both frequencies at the same time. A dual band access point can use one radio to transmit at one frequency, and a different radio to transmit at a different frequency.

All speeds and distances are theoretical and will typically be achieved only in an optimal environment.

- Transmission speeds are affected by distance, obstructions (such as walls), and interference.
- Maximum signal distance depends on several factors, including obstructions, antenna strength, and interference. For example, the actual distance for communications in a typical environment (with one or two walls) is roughly half of the maximum.
- Because transmission speeds decrease with distance, either the maximum distance or the maximum speed can be achieved, but not both.

Newer 802.11 standards have added new technologies in order to increase potential bandwidth and transmission distance. The following table provides details for these technologies.

|Technology|Details|
|---|---|
|Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output  <br>(MIMO)|MIMO increases bandwidth by using multiple antennas for both the transmitter and receiver.<br><br>- A system is described by the number of sending and receiving antennas. The 802.11n specifications allow up to four sending and four receiving antennas.<br>- MIMO relies on beamforming to deliver better speeds. _Beamforming_ focuses the signal to a specific receiving device which results in a higher quality signal.|
|Multi-User MIMO  <br>(MU-MIMO)|MU-MIMO is an enhancement to MIMO that allows multiple users to use the same channel.  <br>  <br>In addition to adding MU-MIMO, 802.11ac doubled the number of MIMO radio streams from four to eight.|
|Channel bonding|Channel bonding combines two, non-overlapping 20 MHz channels into a single 40 MHz channel. This results in slightly more than double the bandwidth.<br><br>- The 5 GHz range has a total of 23 channels, with 12 non-overlapping. This allows for a maximum of six non-overlapping bonded (combined) channels.<br>- The 2.4 GHz range has a total of 11 channels, with three non-overlapping. This allows for a maximum of one non-overlapping bonded channel. For this reason, channel bonding is typically not practical for the 2.4 GHz range.|

**Long-Range Wireless**

A long-range wireless network is typically setup to connect two buildings together on the same network. Depending on the distance between the network locations, different solutions are available.

- If the locations are only a short distance apart, you can install a high-end wireless access point with special antennas. These networks still use the unlicensed frequencies and appropriate 802.11 standard.
- If the network locations are spread across a longer distance, special equipment is needed. These long-range networks also need special permission to use a licensed frequency range such as 900 MHz or 3.65 GHz.
- Regardless of the range, some wireless access points allow the power to be increased. Increasing the power allows the access point to transmit a longer distance, but can lead to overheating and instability.
- Always follow FCC guidance and requirements if increasing the power as this can cause interference with other wireless devices in the area.

## Wireless Security Facts
----

Wireless networks are everywhere. When a user connects to a wireless network, the expectation is that the connection is secure and the data is protected. Because the wireless signal is an unbounded medium, anyone can intercept the data if it is not properly secured.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Authentication protocols
- Encryption protocols
- Additional wireless security measures


**Authentication Protocol**

A user must first be authenticated before connecting to the wireless network. Authentication is the process of proving the user's identity and proving that the user is allowed to be on the network. The following table describes some authentication methods.

|Access Method|Description|
|---|---|
|Pre-shared key  <br>(PSK)|This is probably the most commonly used access method. A pre-shared key is a passphrase a user enters to access the wireless network.|
|Wi-Fi Protected Setup  <br>(WPS)|Wi-Fi Protected Setup works only on a network that uses a PSK and an appropriate encryption protocol, such as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) or Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3). WPS allows a device to securely connect to a wireless network without entering the PSK. To connect to a device:<br><br>- You first press the button on the access point that initiates a search for devices in range.<br>- The connecting device may have a WPS button that will automatically join it to the access point.<br>- If there is no button, you enter (on the device) the eight-digit pin unique to the access point.<br><br>Some devices and access points can also use NFC during the WPS process to connect to each other.|
|Open network|An open network has no authentication. It allows anyone to connect to the network. This access method should be used only in public places that want to offer free wireless access.|
|Captive portal|Many open networks implement a captive portal.<br><br>- After a device connects to the wireless network but before it can access the internet, the user is redirected to a captive portal page.<br>- The user might be prompted to agree to the terms and conditions of using the network or even asked to pay a fee before being granted internet access.|
|802.1x|Enterprise level networks need a high level of security. Many enterprise networks use the 802.1x protocol to authenticate users to the wireless network.  <br>  <br>802.1x is a standard for local area networks created by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE-SA). This standard is often labeled IEEE 802.1x.  <br>  <br>On a wired network, user authentication activates the port the user is connected to. If the user activation fails, the port remains off. You implement the 802.1x protocol in a wireless network by enabling a virtual port when the user is authenticated. There are three components in a wireless 802.1x setup:<br><br>1. Supplicant – The wireless client.<br>2. Authenticator – This device responsible for handling the communications between the supplicant and authentication server.<br>3. Authentication server – The server that contains the centralized database for user authentication.<br><br>802.1x implementations on wireless networks often use Remote Authentication Dial-In Service (RADIUS). RADIUS was developed in 1991. It was originally used to authenticate users to the remote network over a dial-up network. RADIUS is known as a triple-A protocol. This means it provides authentication, authorization, and accounting management.  <br>  <br>When using 802.1x authentication for wireless networks with RADIUS, keep in mind:<br><br>- A RADIUS server is required to centralize user account and authentication information. A centralized database for user authentication is required to allow wireless clients to roam between cells and authenticate using the same account information.<br>- A PKI is required for issuing certificates. At a minimum, the RADIUS server must have a server certificate. To support mutual authentication, each client must also have a certificate.<br>- The wireless access point is a RADIUS client.<br>- The wireless access point forwards the wireless device's credentials to the RADIUS server for authentication.<br>- A RADIUS federation is multiple RADIUS servers that communicate with each other after establishing a trust relationship. These servers may be on different networks and could span multiple organizations.|

**Encryption Protocols**

Enabling the proper encryption protocol is perhaps the most important security setting for a wireless network. For most users, WPA2 or WPA3 will be the best option. The following table explains these two protocols:

|Cryptographic Protocol|Description|
|---|---|
|WPA2|WPA2 is the implementation name for wireless security that adheres to the 802.11i specifications. It was introduced in 2004 and is still heavily used in today's networks. There are two version of WPA2 available:  <br><br>- WPA2-Personal – Also known as WPA2-PSK. This version uses a pre-shared key (passphrase) to protect the network.<br>- - WPA2-PSK uses Advanced Encryption Standard-Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (AES-CCMP) to encrypt all data. AES is the encryption algorithm. AES-CCMP uses a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size.<br>    - When a device connects to the access point, a 4-way handshake occurs to authenticate the device.<br>        - The process uses the pre-shared key and SSID to generate a session key during this process.<br>        - The handshake does have some vulnerabilities that a hacker can use to intercept the data and perform offline password attacks against.<br>    - WPA2-Enterprise – This version uses a RADIUS server to authenticate users to the network.|
|WPA3|WPA3 was introduced in 2018 to address the vulnerabilities inherent in the WPA2 handshake and to support newer technologies. Instead of using the pre-shared key, WPA3 implements the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) standard.  <br><br>- SAE uses a 128-bit key and perfect forward secrecy to authenticate users.<br>- Perfect forward secrecy is a cryptography method that generates a new key for every transmission. This makes the handshake much more secure from hackers. If any portion of the handshake is intercepted, the key is still unable to be cracked.|

**Additional Wireless Security Measures**

Additional security measures you can implement on all wireless networks include:

- Change the default username and password for the wireless access point.
    - The default username and passwords for many wireless access points are readily available on the internet.
    - A potential attacker will typically attempt to use these credentials first.
- Disabling the SSID broadcast will help hide the network from the casual observer. A potential attacker can still easily discover the SSID, but disabling the SSID broadcast creates an extra step.
- Enable MAC address filtering.
    - This setting allows access only to devices with the specified MAC addresses.
    - A potential attacker is still able to intercept the signal and identify the MAC address of an allowed device and then spoof that MAC address to gain access. However, enabling MAC address filtering creates an additional barrier for the attacker.
- Update the wireless access point firmware. As security threats become known, manufacturers often release fixes to address known issues to prevent attacks.
- Enable and properly configure the firewall. The firewall will help in stopping an attacker from gaining access through open ports.  
    

While there is no one definitive method to secure a wireless network, implementing multiple security measures make it more difficult for an attacker to gain access.
