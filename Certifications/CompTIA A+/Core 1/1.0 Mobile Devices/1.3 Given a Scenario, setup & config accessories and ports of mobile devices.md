## Mobile Device Facts
----

**Mobile Devices**
The following table describes the most common mobile devices you will encounter.

|Device|Description|
|---|---|
|Tablet|A tablet uses a touch screen interface rather than the touchpad, mouse, and keyboard used by desktop and notebook computers. The touch screen interface is usually capacitive meaning it recognizes fingertip input.<br><br>- Capacitive touch screens provide multi-touch or gestures that allow the tablet to recognize simultaneous multiple finger touches.<br>- Many tablets implement a stylus or pen for more precise drawing and control.<br>- Most tablets use the iOS, Android, or iPadOS operating systems.|
|Smart phone|Smart phones combine the functionality of a cellular phone with the features of a desktop computer.<br><br>- Smart phones can access the internet either through a Wi-Fi connection or by using a 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, and/or LTE cellular connection.<br>- They can also function as a GPS navigation unit, a portable gaming device, and a mobile music player.<br>- Smart phones typically have a screen size between 2.5 inches and 6+ inches.<br>- Most smart phones use the Android or iOS operating system.<br>- Many smart phones can also be used as a mobile WiFi hotspot enabling other devices to access the internet via the phone's WiFi adapter.|
|Wearable device|Wearable devices are a type of mobile device meant to be worn somewhere on the body. These devices range from a fitness tracker wrist band to virtual reality headsets.  <br>  <br>Most wearable devices are designed to interface with another device. For example, smart watches are designed to connect to smart phones using Bluetooth. Doing this enables additional functionality, such as reading texts or answering phones calls through the smart watch.|
|Webcam|Webcams are camera and microphone systems that allow users to communicate through the internet with audio and video. Many laptops have a built-in webcam, but you can purchase one and connect it to the computer through a USB port.|
|E-reader|E-readers are similar to a tablet; however, they are often used only for reading and do not include many of the apps available on tablets. Their primary purpose is for reading digital books, newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals. Most e-readers use E Ink to display digital content.  <br>  <br>E Ink is a special technology that creates a high-contrast, black and white display. Even though E Ink screens display only grayscale, they are great for e-readers because they consume much less power than LCD screens and their output can be seen even in direct sunlight.|


## Mobile Connection Facts
----
**Mobile Connections**
Most mobile devices share similar design and functionality traits. Most allow for external connectivity via wired and wireless technologies. Many of those traits are described in the following table.

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Universal Serial Bus|Universal Serial Bus (USB) is the most predominant connection type and the most versatile for mobile devices. USB is used to connect most external devices to a PC or tablet. There are different versions of USB:<br><br>- USB v2.0—used to connect keyboards, mice, printers, flash drives etc.<br>- USB v3.0—the same as v2.0, but faster. It introduced new type B connectors.<br>- USB-C—a newer technology with different connectivity. It is used for all external devices including displays and Ethernet adapters.<br><br>USB has three connection types:<br><br>- The A connector is generally used to plug into the mobile device.<br>- The B connector is generally used to plug into the external device. It includes:<br>    - Standard—older connector used mainly to connect to external hard drives and printers.<br>    - MiniUSB—smaller version of USB connector used for connections as well as charging external devices.<br>    - MicroUSB—same as MiniUSB, but smaller.<br>    - Standard 3.0—dual connection, top and bottom, allowing for higher throughput on capable devices.<br>    - MicroUSB 3.0—dual connection, side-to-side. It has the same connectivity as Standard 3.0.<br>- The C connector is used for connecting external devices including displays and Ethernet adapters.<br>    - It may use type A or C to plug into mobile devices.<br>    - It uses type C to plug into external devices.|
|Serial interfaces|Devices that use a serial interface include computers, routers, and switches.<br><br>- Serial allows devices to communicate via a stream of binary digits. There may be control signals embedded in the stream to mark the beginning or end of characters or to enable parity.<br>- Many serial connectors are a 9 pin D connector. However, some use a proprietary connector that has a specific use.<br>    - While no longer widely used, serial communication was used to connect external serial devices to computers.<br>    - These devices included printers, modems, scanners, and other serial devices.|
|Near-field communications|NFC is a newer wireless technology. It is mostly used with credit cards allowing the user to tap the credit card rather than swipe it or insert it into the chip reader.  <br>  <br>It can also be used to transfer data between mobile devices. NFC's wireless range is less than one inch and uses very little power.|
|Bluetooth|Bluetooth is a low-power, short-distance wireless technology. It supports a 10-meter radius for connectivity and is usually used for multimedia.<br><br>- Often users use Bluetooth with earbuds, headphones, and speakers.<br>- Bluetooth is also used to connect printers wirelessly.<br>- Bluetooth requires devices be paired before they can be used.|
|Hotspot|Many smartphones can enable a hotspot feature. This feature allows the user to turn the smartphone into a WiFi hotspot.<br><br>- The smartphone uses its cellular connection to the internet and provides a WiFi host allowing WiFi enabled devices to connect and use the smartphone's internet connection.<br>- This is useful for any mobile device that does not have direct access to the internet.<br>- Several cellular providers offer devices specifically designed to do this; however, providing a hotspot is their only function. These devices generally sell for a fraction the cost of a mobile phone.|

## Mobile Device Accessory Facts
----
Mobile phone accessories include hardware or software that is not integral to the operation of a mobile phone as designed by the manufacturer. The following table describes common mobile accessories.

|Accessory|Description|
|---|---|
|Headsets|Mobile headsets allow you to listen to music and answer phone calls. Mobile headsets come in several varieties and options. They include:<br><br>- Corded with connections for audio and microphone.<br>- Universal Serial Bus (USB).<br>- Wireless with over-ear and ear buds.|

|Gamepads|Gamepads allow you to turn a mobile device into a virtual multi-touch gamepad for PC games through a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection.|
|Docking stations/port replicators|Docking stations and port replicators can provide the desktop experience for laptop computers. Devices (such as keyboard, mouse, and monitor) connect to the docking station; then the laptop connects to the docking station.  <br>  <br>There are also docking stations/port replicators for other mobile devices such as mobile phones and gaming devices. Standards for each are typically specific to the device docked.|
|Extra batteries/chargers|Cell phone chargers have gone through an evolution that included cradles, plug-in cords, and (most recently) wireless charging.<br><br>- Many devices have micro-USB or USB-C connections.<br>- Apple devices often use Lightning cables.<br>- External batteries can be included in the case (power case).<br><br>Portable devices go through a constant change, improving as they go.|
|Protective covers|Protective covers or cases are designed to attach to, support, and hold a mobile device. Protective covers are meant to protect a mobile device from accidental drops, shock, and water. Several cases have convenient straps or handles that make the device easier to hold and use.  <br>  <br>Protective covers include:<br><br>- Pouches and sleeves<br>- Holsters<br>- Shells<br>- Skins<br>- Bumpers<br>- Flip cases and wallets<br>- Screen protection and body films<br>- Leather cases|
|Credit card readers|A credit card reader allows you to accept credit and debit cards payments through a smart phone or tablet.|
|Medical accessories|You can use mobile devices with medical technology. Mobile devices use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology to communicate with the medical device (e.g., fingertip electrocardiogram (EKG) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for diabetes patients).|
|Memory/microSD|Some smart phones feature SD card slots, usually for the smaller microSD. You can use SD cards to transfer files from one device to another or to increase the storage capacity of a device.|

## Wireless & Cellular Data connections Facts
----
**Mobile Connection Types**
The following table describes mobile connection types.

|Connection Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Generations (G)|Cellular networks used for voice and data include the following types:<br><br>- Second generation (2G) networks were the first to offer digital data services. 2G data speeds are slow and mainly used for text messaging, not internet connectivity. 2.5G supports speeds up to 144 Kbps.<br>- EDGE (also called 2.75G) networks are an intermediary between 2G and 3G networks. EDGE is the first cellular technology to be truly internet compatible. EDGE supports speeds of 400–1,000 Kbps.<br>- 3G offers simultaneous voice and data. Minimum speeds for stationary users are quoted at 2 Mbps or higher. The following extensions enhance 3G networks:<br>    - Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) is also called smart antenna. It uses multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). It significantly increases data throughput and link range without additional bandwidth or increased transmit power.<br>    - Long Term Evolution (LTE) increases downlink/uplink speeds to 100/50 Mbps, while LTE-Advanced increases downlink/uplink speeds to 1Gbps/500Mbps.<br>- 4G is available with minimum speeds around 3–8 Mbps and over 100 Mbps possible. 4G features include:<br>    - Uses MIMO.<br>    - Is not compatible with 3G; 4G requires a complete retrofit on the part of service providers and new equipment for the consumer.<br>    - Utilizes Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). WiMAX delivers high-speed internet service (up to 1 Gbps for stationary users) to large geographical areas.<br>- 5G can achieve speeds twenty times faster than 4G with peak speeds of 20 Gb per second. 5G features include:<br>    - Uses MIMO.<br>    - Includes lower frequencies than previous generations, down to 600 MHz.<br>    - Uses LTE for wireless connections.|
|Hotspot|A hotspot is a physical location where you can obtain wireless internet access using a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a router connected to an internet service provider.|
|Tethering|Tethering is connecting one device to another to share the internet connection of the phone or tablet with other devices like laptops. You can tether devices over wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, or by physical connection using a cable, e.g., USB.|
|Airplane mode|Airplane mode is a setting that suspends the device's radio-frequency signal transmitting functions and disables telephone, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. This setting is available on many smart phones, portable computers, and other electronic devices.|
|Virtual private network (VPN)|A mobile VPN provides mobile devices with wired or wireless access to network resources and software applications on their home network.|
|Bluetooth|Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that connects multiple devices and avoids problems of synchronization. You can use it to exchange data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices, and for building personal area networks (PANs).|
|Near-field communication (NFC)|An NFC connection offers low-speed communication to bootstrap two electronic devices in near space of 4 cm or less. NFC can emulate keycards, electronic identity documents, or memory cards.|
|miniUSB  <br>microUSB|A mini-USB connector is a small USB cable connector that is often used by handheld electronic devices like mobile phones, MP3 players, and digital cameras.<br><br>- On mobile phones it is used for both USB data connectivity and charging.<br>- The new connector, called micro-USB, is smaller than the mini-USB connector and allows for even thinner device designs<br><br>.|
|Lightning|Lightning is a proprietary computer bus and power connector created by Apple. It replaces the previous 30-pin dock connector. You use it to connect Apple mobile devices like iPhones, iPads and iPods to host computers, external monitors, cameras, USB battery chargers, and other peripherals.|
|Infrared  <br>(IR)|An IR port is a port on a mobile device that enables devices to exchange data without using cables.|
|Metered connections and limitations|A metered internet connection uses a wired or wireless adapter to limit the amount of data a computer can receive per day or month, depending on the plan.<br><br>- When you use both adapters, you can set both to metered or set just one, depending on what you need.<br>- Some metered connections allow you to throttle (slow down and stop) internet usage as you get close to the limit.<br>- Throttling helps prevent you from going over the limit and being charged for extra data usage.|
|Cellular location services|Cellular Location Services allow apps to track the device's approximate position. They may use GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth data, QR codes, or RFID technology. You have the option to allow or disallow apps from using location tracking. Keep in mind:<br><br>- Some apps with services such as ridesharing, directions, and delivery depend on this tracking to function.<br>- When you choose to disallow them from tracking you, their services might be very limited.<br>- You can personalize services to your needs by choosing which apps track your location and which don't.<br>- You can also set the permission to allow tracking only while an app is open. Once you close it, the service can't track the device.<br>- Some apps may track location for advertisement, entertainment, or security purposes.|
|Global Positioning System  <br>(GPS)|GPS is a navigation system made of several satellites, a receiver, and algorithms to determine position and/or travel paths using location, velocity, and time data.<br><br>- The receiver measures the distance to each satellite by the amount of time it takes to receive a sent signal.<br>- After receiving the results from several satellites, it determines the position and displays it electronically.<br>- It can also determine the path taken since it started tracking and the path that should be taken depending on the desired destination.<br><br>.|
|Preferred Roaming List  <br>(PRL)|PRL is a database in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless devices. The information is used during the system selection and acquisition process.<br><br>- In the case of cellphones, it's built and provided by the carrier to connect the phone to the tower.<br>- It dictates which radio bands, sub-bands, and service provider IDs the phone will search for. Then, it connect to the right tower.<br>- Without a correct and valid PRL, the phone can't roam outside the home network and may not be able to connect at all inside the network.<br>- The database is made of an acquisition table listing the radio frequencies to search for in certain areas.<br>- It has a system table to tell the phone which towers allow connection and the best order.<br>- It doesn't mean the phone will always connect to the strongest tower available.<br>- When you're in an area with weak, but steady signal from your carrier, the PRL will connect you to your carrier signal instead of connecting to a stronger signal on a different carrier.|
|Global System for Mobiles (GSM) vs (CDMA)|CDMA and GSM are older radio systems also known as 2G and 3G.<br><br>- These networks are slowly fading away and being replaced by 4G and 5G.<br>- Most cell phones are already on 4G and 5G.<br>- Some older model phones may still use 2G and 3G, but may experience poor call quality as more and more providers formally shutdown these older networks.<br><br>Both CDMA and GSM have multiple access standards that allow multiple calls to go through a single tower.<br><br>- Some noticeable differences between these two systems is that GSM devices come with a SIM card slot, but CDMA devices do not.<br>- This means CDMA phones are a handset-based standard, with a phone number linked to a particular device.<br>- To upgrade to another phone, a person must contact the network carrier, de-activate the old device and activate the new one.<br>- GSM devices have the phone number linked to the SIM card. To change devices, you take out the SIM card from the old device and place it into the new device.|

#### Preferred Roaming List PRL
----
When we move a phone, tablet, or other mobile device from place to place, it connects to the nearest tower that works with its cellular connection technology and through the mobile service provider. My phone—or other mobile device—needs to know how and when to connect to a different provider's network. Some providers partner with each other to keep roaming fees down for their customers. Other providers don't. The PRL lets the phone know what to do outside its home area. Should it connect to non-partner towers and let me incur fees? Should it just wait until I am back in the home or partner service area?

#### Location Services

Speaking of roaming, another great feature on nearly all smartphones is location services. There's an old saying, "Not all who wander are lost." Using services, such as GPS, helps us keep from getting lost when we choose to wander! Thanks to smartphones, most of us have GPS location services riding around in our pockets or bags. We no longer need to purchase dedicated GPS devices.  

In addition to GPS, we also have cellular location services. Every cell phone tower has a mapped location and service area. The service areas overlap, so a phone's location can be determined by its ability to connect to the towers in the overlapping area. This helps increase the accuracy of GPS, but it also is good for helping to locate a lost or stolen phone if the GPS has been disabled. Just keep in mind that we do need to keep our location services enabled to take advantage of these features, although many of us turn them off to help save battery.
## MDM & Synchronization Facts
----
**Data Synchronization**
Data synchronization is the process that maintains data consistency between the source and target. Key points are:

- You can synchronize data between a cloud account, PC system, or even a car.
- Data synchronization can continually update devices.
- You can transfer data based on a scheduled time transfer or triggering event when documents change or a device comes online.
- Microsoft automatically syncs a mobile device with the corresponding Exchange mailbox using ActiveSync. You may already have access to a lot of synchronized information.

Cloud-based file synchronization allows apps on a mobile device to send data to the cloud. A few cloud-based file synchronization providers include Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive. You can also synchronize mobile devices by connecting to a laptop or desktop computer via USB, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. You can configure both a PC and a mobile device to use the same iCloud account.

**Synchronization Software**
You should be aware of software requirements needed to install the synchronization app on the PC or mobile device. Some software requires a specific operating system and cannot run on any other operating system. For example, Android apps run on only Android devices. Apple apps run on only devices with iOS.

Also be aware of hardware synchronization requirements. For desktop synchronization, Windows requires the PC to have 4 GB or more of RAM and at least one USB 2.0 port, with 300 MB of free space on the hard drive. Desktop synchronization software for macOS requires 10.5 or greater on a USB port. Some cloud-based applications have higher requirements.

Be aware of any defaults, limitations, or data caps for the environment. These will determine what is synchronized. Examples include:

- A maximum range of 30 days backwards for synchronizing.
- A maximum number of files per folder.
- A default to include documents smaller than 500 KB but drop any attachments larger than 500 KB.

**Mutual Authentication**
Mutual authentication (also called two-way authentication) is used for services like purchasing music and saving content to the cloud. Mutual authentication schemes ensure data security when transmitting data. Not to be confused with two-factor authentication, mutual authentication is a process where two entities authenticate each other at the same time with two types of credentials such as usernames/ passwords, and public key certificates.

- The client authenticates the server and vice-versa.
- Online services use mutual authentication or single sign-on to allow you to connect to servers to sync data.

For example, iTunes requires you to authenticate to its servers using an Apple ID. At the same time, Apple verifies that the iTunes app on your computer or device is the same app and computer used to access your iTunes account.

**Data to Synchronize**
These are the types of data you can synchronize:

- Contacts
- Programs
- Email
- Pictures
- Music
- Videos
- Calendar
- Bookmarks
- Documents
- Location data
- Social media data
- eBooks
- Passwords

## Mobile Email Config Facts

**Mobile Device Email Service Providers**
You can configure email accounts on a mobile device using email service providers. Well-known email providers include:

- Exchange
- Google/Inbox
- iCloud
- Outlook.com
- Yahoo

**Mobile Device Email Configuration**
You can also add an email account and setup the IP addresses of the POP3, IMAP, or SMTP servers.

- To configure these email accounts, you may need to modify the port settings.
- To encrypt the email, configure the SSL and S/MIME settings. Both SSL and S/MIME securely sign and encrypt email to prove that the email actually came from the person claiming to be the sender.

## Troubleshoot PC Security Facts
----
A compromised system can have symptoms so subtle that a person without an IT background would not attribute the symptoms as being part of an attack. These symptoms can include tasks running in the background and setting changes.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Internet connectivity
- Altered files and permissions
- Network and internet settings
- Software issues
- Virus removal

**Internet Connectivity**
Slow internet speeds or no internet can result from many issues. A security attack is not the first thing you might consider when experiencing connectivity issues, but it is important to not overlook it. There are many types of attacks that can cause a device to have diminished or no connectivity.

- When you detect an intrusion, separate the device from network and check the entire network to ensure the infection has not spread.
- Be thorough with the virus and malware removal. Check all browser and internet settings.
- Also check user files and OS files for changes.

**Altered Files and Permission**
As part of an attack, files may be altered and permissions changed.

- Once in a system, an attacker can move, copy, and delete files.
- An attacker can also change permissions which can lock users and groups out of shared files.

**Network and Internet Settings**
An attacker can also change internet settings. This allows the redirection of traffic to locations where the attacker can retrieve it. The following table describes settings that an attacker might change.

|Settings|Description|
|---|---|
|Proxy settings|Adjusting the proxy settings can redirect the user to a location where the attacker can integrate penetration tools for finding vulnerabilities. To avoid this, ensure that a user who is part of the proxy server has the IP address and ports correctly configured.|
|DNS settings|An attacker can configure the DNS server to take the user outside the network and onto a similar web page. To avoid this, make sure that the internet properties for DNS are correctly set up.|
|Host files|Check host files to ensure that the name of the user is correctly configured with the server.|

**Software Issues**
A few software issues may seem minor, but they can be evidence of a breached computer on the network.

- A notification that looks and acts like it is part of the operating system notification system can be viral in nature. These notifications generally have links to redirect the user to nefarious sites.
- The browser can exhibit unwanted behaviors such as:
    - The browser opening to a strange search engine page.
    - Slow load times.
    - Added tool bars.
    - Broken links.
    - Unresponsive websites.
- Updates that don't complete can be caused by a virus that prevents security downloads installing. This can allow an attack to remain undetected by the user and the malware scanner.

**Virus Removal**
When you are aware the system is breached or infected, it is important to disconnect the device from the network. Scan all devices on the network while performing the virus removal process.

- Always create a backup before you start to remove files and programs from the OS.
- Run the virus removal program in safe mode.
- Disable the backup utility before you run the scanner.
- Delete all previous backups.
- Viruses can hide in the backup files and will reinstall if you use previous backups.
- Run the approved malware scanner. Quarantine and delete the malware.
- Re-initialize the back up software and complete a new backup when the removal is complete, .
- Once the file and OS backup is complete, you can destroy the original backup.
## Troubleshoot Mobile OS Security Facts
----
Handheld devices are small computers that can fit in the palm of a hand. Their potential for compromise is exponentially increased due to their mobility. Also, they can easily cause security risks to other devices and systems including a network.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Malicious software
- Feature vulnerabilities
- Symptoms of a compromised device
- User education

**Malicious Software**
As with regular computers, there are malicious programs that target handheld devices for personal information such as passwords and browser settings.

|Malicious Software|Definition|
|---|---|
|Spoofed applications|These applications look like the real program. Untrusted third-party websites can have infected versions of real applications. Not all third-party websites are bad, but due to poor security restrictions these websites might not catch malware.|
|Android Package Kit (APK) files|Trusted websites that create installation software for handheld devices use APK files.<br><br>- These files have signatures that allow only the vendor to install software on the manufacturer's devices.<br>- This means that a handheld device must recognize the application as being from a trusted source.<br>- The only way to download applications from an untrusted site is to allow installations of non-market applications in the settings menu.<br><br>If a user experiences slow performance and connectivity issues, check the device's applications and settings to see if the user has downloaded malicious software.|

**Feature Vulnerabilities**
There are certain settings on most mobile devices that are enabled for protection and security. Devices that support Android use open source software, which means that even though it is convenient (and often times free) the software can also affect the operating system (OS) files.  
  
In the settings menu there are features that keep the system files safe and allow only trusted software to be installed. If a user disables these features (referred to as jailbreaking), the device is vulnerable to security breaches.

|Feature Vulnerabilities|Definitions|
|---|---|
|Jailbreaking|Jailbreaking a mobile device disables security features of the device. Manufacturers enable these functions to protect the device from malicious programs. Once the mobile device is unlocked (jailbroken) operating system files, can be exploited.  <br>  <br>If a user has problems with a device, determine if the security features have been unlocked and determine the apps that were installed before the issues began. This may narrow the search down to finding malicious software.|
|Developer Mode|This mode allows software developers and manufacturers to create and test applications and new features on mobile devices. Some users turn this feature on to allow more versatility to the device. This can also lead to unlocking OS files and leaving them vulnerable to attack.  <br>  <br>Ensuring that developer mode is disabled or asking the user if it is enabled can help you solve the issues with the device.|

**Symptoms of a Compromised Device**
Sometimes symptoms may not be apparent to the user. An annoyance may seem like an issue with a provider, network, or an older device that just isn't as fast as the newer ones. Good malware can be subtle and unnoticeable. Some symptoms may lead you to security vulnerabilities that have been exploited.

|Symptoms|Definitions|
|---|---|
|Connectivity|A sluggish device may be caused by an application leaking data and using all its bandwidth to constantly transmit its signal. This is one of the most overlooked signs of a compromised device. There are so many connectivity-related issues that malware may not be the first thing to come to mind. A good practice is to:<br><br>- See if anyone else is having the same issue with a similar device.<br>- Check applications running on the device to see if you are familiar with them.<br>- Determine the applications that are using the most the bandwidth.|
|Increased data usage|If the user has increased data usage, an application might be broadcasting data without permission.|
|False security warnings|Like a desktop, a mobile device can visit sites that inform the users that they have a virus; the site might even lock the browser. These false warnings will have contact information (URL or a phone number) for help. This is where the virus is really downloaded and/or information is exchanged and vulnerabilities exploited.  <br>  <br>If you suspect malware is installed on the device, running a malware scanner and removal program is the best solution for the device. Be sure that you back up the information before performing the removal.|

**User Education**
The best practice is to engage users in protecting their devices. Train users in the power of preventatives measure such as:

- Enabling user authentication.
- Updating software as soon as updates are available.
- Avoiding public Wi-Fi usage.
- Using a password manager and cloud back-ups to secure data.
