## AZAD
----
**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** is Microsoft’s cloud-based **identity and access management** service, which helps your employees sign in and access resources​.

**Azure AD** takes this approach to the next level by providing organizations with an **Identity as a Service (IDaaS)** solution for all their apps **across cloud and on-premises**.​

**Azure Active Directory comes in four editions​**

1. **Free** MFA, SSO, Basic Security and Usage Reports, User Management​
2. **Office 365 Apps** Company Branding, SLA, Two-Sync between On-Premise and Cloud​
3. **Premium 1** Hybrid Architecture, Advanced Group Access, Conditional Access​
4. **Premium 2** Identity Protection, Identity Governance

**Azure AD** can **authorize** and **authenticate** to multiple sources.​

- To your on-premise AD ​
- To your web-application​
- Allow users to login with their IpD eg. Facebook or Google ​
- To Office 365 or **Azure Microsoft**

**Active Directory Terminology**

**Domain​**

A domain is an area of a network organized by a single authentication database​

An **Active Directory** domain is a **logical grouping** of AD objects on a network​

**Domain Controller (DC)​**

A domain controller is a server that **authenticates** user identities and **authorizes** their access to resources.​

**Domain Computer​**

A computer that is registered with a central authentication database A domain computer would be an AD Object​

**AD Object​**

An AD Object is the basic element of Active Directory such as:​

Users, Groups, Printers, Computers, Shared folders​

**Group Policy Object (GPO)​**

A virtual collection of policy settings. It controls what AD Objects have access to​

**Organization Units (OU)​**

A subdivision within an Active Directory into which you can place users, groups, computers, and other organizational units​

**Directory Service​**

A directory service, such as **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**, provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. A Directory service runs on a Domain Controller​

**A tenant** **represents an organization** in Azure Active Directory. ​

A tenant is a dedicated Azure AD Service instance.​

**A tenant is automatically created when you sign up for either​**

- Microsoft Azure​
- Microsoft Intune​
- Microsoft 365 ​

**Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** provides **managed domain service** such as:​

- Domain joins​
- Group policies​
- Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)​
- and Kerberos / NTLM authentication.​

Azure AD Connect has the following features:​

- **Password hash synchronization** — sign-in method, synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD password with Azure AD​
    
- **Pass-through authentication** — sign-in method, allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud​
    
- **Federation integration** — hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure, for certificate renewal ​
    
- **Synchronization** — Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects, ensures on-prem and cloud data matches​
    
- **Health Monitoring** — robust monitoring and provide a central location in the Azure portal ← (Azure AD Connect Health) to view this activity​
    

**Users** represent an **identity for an person or employee** in your domain.​

Azure AD has two kinds of users:​

- **Users** — A user belongs to your organization​
- **Guest Users** — A guest user belongs to another organization​

​**Groups​** lets the resource owner (or Azure AD directory owner), assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group, instead of having to provide the rights one-by-one. ​

​**Groups contain:​​**

- **Owners** — Has permissions to add and remove members
- **Members** — Have permissions to do things​

​**Assignment​​**

- You can assign roles directly to a group​
- You can assign applications directly to a group​

There are **four ways** to **assign resource access rights** to your users:​

**Direct assignment.** The resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource.​

**Group assignment.** The resource owner assigns an Azure AD group to the resource, which automatically gives all of the group members access to the resource​

**Rule-based assignment.** The resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users are assigned to a specific resource. ​

**External authority assignment.** Access comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app. ​

# Storage Account
----
|Node in data center unavailable|Entire data center unavailable|Region-wide outage|Read access during region-wide outage|
|---|---|---|---|
|- **LRS**  <br>- **ZRS**  <br>- **GRS**  <br>- **RA-GRS**  <br>- **GZRS**  <br>- **RA-GZRS**|- **ZRS**  <br>- **GRS**  <br>- **RA-GRS**  <br>- **GZRS**  <br>- **RA-GZRS**|- **GRS**  <br>- **RA-GRS**  <br>- **GZRS**  <br>- **RA-GZRS**|- **RA-GRS**  <br>- **RA-GZRS**|

Locally redundant storage (LRS)
- replicates data and stores 3 copies across fault domains, or racks of hardware, within a single datacenter in 1 region.
- You are not protected if there's a datacenter outage.
- Least expensive replication options, least durable
Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
- Replicates your data across 3 storage clusters in a region.
- Physically separated from the other two.  
    - each cluster is supplied by separate utilities such as power or networking
-  99.999999999999 up time
- not protected from regional outages
- To migrate data to ZRS from LRS or GRS requires some planning and manual migration, and it requires a tool such as AZCopy
Geographically Redundant storage (GRS)
- Replicated 3x within primary region, then is replicated to a 2nd region
- Highest level of durability
- 2nd region is automatically paired and can not change this pairing
- 2nd region is inaccessible until the primary region fails.
Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
- 99.9999999999999999 percent durability
- ideal for applications that require high availability
- After failover and DNS endpoint updates are completed. the storage account is set to LRS. You're responsible for reverting back to RA-GRS or GRS
Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)
- Combines ZRS and GRS.
- Data is replicated 3 availability zones in 1 region. Data is also replicated 3x to another 2nd region
Read-Access Geo Zone Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)
- Same replication method as GZRS, but lets you read from 2nd location

When to use each type 
|Replication type|Copies|Use case|
|---|---|---|
|LRS|3|Data remains highly available, but for compliance reasons, isn't allowed to leave the local datacenter.|
|ZRS|3|Needs redundancy in multiple physical locations, but because of compliance, data isn't allowed to leave a region.|
|GRS|6|App has access to the data, even if an entire region has an outage.|
|RA-GRS|6|App reads from multiple geographical locations, so you can serve users from a location that's closer to them.|
|GZRS|6|App can access data, even if the primary region fails, and your secondary region has a 
datacenter that's experiencing an outage, but you don't want to read from the secondary region unless the primary region is down.|
|RA-GZRS|6|Regularly read data from your secondary region, perhaps to serve users from a location closer to them, even if a datacenter is up in your primary region.|

## Exercise - Creating an AZ storage account
-----
This exercise you will create an AZ storage account and config the account for RA-GRS. Default is LRS
```bash
STORAGEACCT=$(az storage account create \
        --resource-group "" \
        --name healthcareapp$RANDOM \
        --sku Standard_RAGRS \
        --output tsv \
        --query "name")

echo $STORAGEACCT
```




----
Failover is automatic and controlled by Microsoft. A manual failover of an Azure storage account isn't possible in most Azure regions. However, Microsoft has made a new feature available in WestUS2 and CentralUS regions with which you can manually failover the storage account by using the following command:

BashCopy

```
az storage account failover --name "storageaccountname"
```
----

Fail Over -- Circuit Breaker
When you implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, set the _LocationMode_ of read requests appropriately. Most of the time, you should set this mode to _PrimaryThenSecondary_. If the read from the primary location times out, the secondary location is used. However, this process can slow down an application if it's done repeatedly. After the circuit breaker detects that the primary location is unavailable, it should switch the mode to _SecondaryOnly_. This action ensures that read operations don't wait for a timeout from the primary location before trying the secondary location. When the circuit breaker estimates that the primary location has been repaired, it can revert back to the _PrimaryThenSecondary_ mode.


### Deploy Highly Available Application
----
You're now ready to start implementing the design to deploy a highly available application. To test the application, download and install Fiddler.

Recall that your application needs to automatically fail over and use the storage accounts at the secondary location if there's a failed connection to the primary region that holds your data in Azure storage. The circuit breaker forces the application to behave in this manner. When the primary location is back online, the circuit breaker reroutes the application back to the primary region.

Before you commit to full-blown development of the healthcare application, you want to test this approach by using a sample application with dummy data.

In this exercise, you run an application that shows how you can use the Circuit Breaker pattern with an RA-GRS storage account. When a problem is detected, the application switches to the secondary storage account, and it switches back to the primary location when it's available again. The application uploads a file to Blob storage and then loops, repeatedly downloading the same file. If there's an error reading the storage account from the primary location, the application retries the operation. If the retry fails after repeated attempts, the application switches to the storage account at the secondary location. The application reads the data from the secondary location until the number of reads exceeds a specified threshold. The application then attempts to switch back to the primary location, but it returns to the secondary location if the primary location is still unavailable.

#### What is Fiddler?

Fiddler is a non-Microsoft tool that's used to help debug applications, particularly web applications. It captures network traffic between computers and, based on the result, uses its event-based scripting subsystem to halt connections.

In this unit, you use Fiddler Classic to monitor the connection to the storage account for the healthcare application. When the application detects that consultants are no longer able to download blobs from storage, it starts a failover to the secondary storage account. When it detects that the primary connection is available again, it redirects the connections to the primary location. In Fiddler, you can see the traffic being directed to the various storage account endpoints.

If you don't have Fiddler Classic installed already, download and install it from the [Telerik Fiddler home page](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler).

 Note

Fiddler has released a new version of their application. This exercise uses Fiddler Classic, which is currently only available for Windows.
