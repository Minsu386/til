Azure Virtual WAN is a consolidated networking service that brings many networking,security, and routing functionalities in a single operational interface

These functionalities include: 
- brance connectivity ( via connectivity automation from Virtual WAN partners devices such as SD-WAN or VPN CPE)
- Site-to-Site VPN connectivity, 
- Remote user VPN (point-to-site)
- connectivity, private (ExpressRoute) connectivity
- Intra-cloud connectivity (transitive connectivity for virtual networks)
- VPN ExpressRoute inter-connectivity
- Routing
- Azure Firewall encryption for private connectivity

Azure Virtual WAN itself is a Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN)

Azure Virtual WAN is much better way to route to your branches, data centers, VNet, and Cloud services

A Point of Presense (PoP) is an entry at the edge of a Network. e.g, ISP Datacenter

A Hop is when you change networks

Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) a method of packet forwarding where instead of using IP Address and Layer 3 information to make forwarding decision an MPLS label is used to determine the shortest route to end destination

Software Defined WAN (SD_WAN) decouples CPU intensive tasks from routers such as management, Operations, and the controls plane that can now be controlled in a central location remotely and virtually at your HQ, Since most ISPs support SD-WAN architecture you can directly control the flow of traffic through the internet

SD-WAN can replace MLPS, so you traverse the internet instead of a private work

SD-WAN is more cost-effective and require less configuration than an MLPS initially and at scale

SD-WAN is secure b/c you will use HTTPS which is supported by your ISP
